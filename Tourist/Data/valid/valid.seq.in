per day
okay a hundred and forty eight
so it's centrally located uh it's very accessible i can see that from here yes
okay
so i can't walk from-
yes

it looks nice where i'd be staying uh huh
right
oh okay

okay spot on
alright
wow okay
that's pretty convenient
uh huh

nature-related~
uh and the- like the whole place this uh sungei buloh wetland reserve is it like an open space or like wildness~

just one degree cooler
uh and what about the freak weather storms like uh tornados or hurricanes anything like that in singapore
alright good
uh is the water in sentosa is it good for snorkelling also
sentosa island okay
alright and there are no locations for snorkelling
okay
okay and what's that
oh i see
not on the mainland okay good
um is there a big difference- is it better to go to uh this theme park on weekday or on weekend
right
uh no uh maybe the rooms later
yah the location
because i always thought that universal studios was on the mainland
alright i've heard of that
okay and there are some english signs there right
okay
right
five dollars for three to six okay
not bad
is that for breakfast
okay
yes what is this
oh that's fi~ oh what is the average temperature in singapore
okay
so- so thank you very much
yes hello
hello good a~
okay
oh i didn't get your name
what's your name again
yah maybe you can help me out later if it's going to be one night or two nights
yes
so that makes it two of us yes
how much would that be
uh i actually have a thousand dollars- singaporean dollars to spend for that trip
okay
oh yes i forgot to mention that
looks like a museum or some sort of yah
i'd like to try out some things of course food would be number one
oh yes
oh
okay
um hm
yes
oh
oh they are the same rate
so either one is okay alright two three eight is that
yes
alright
okay
okay well if you say so
oh alright
uh i'm not uh very how do i say this
oh
uh i'm quite allergic to crustaceans to shrimps and yah
oh that would be great
well for lunch is that buffet style
ah yes i've heard of it
indian food oh yes
uh huh
fish head curry
we'll uh i'm into desserts and sweets too
yes i think there are cream puffs
uh yes the-
that's right
oh and then it's- the train station is named after them okay
there
uh huh
but not movies not a place
uh huh
uh huh
oh
if the hotel sounds really nice but if i would like to stay in a small house can i rent one for a day
i- hm the hotels sounds nice okay
okay
thank you
alright
yes
and it goes with my budget
oh
you mean cebu pacific
alright
a round trip ticket
oh by the way ma'am what's your religion
will you pick me up at the airport
alright
oh so you mean to say that if i have three thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket there is a tourist guide that will pick me up at the airport
alright
the conversion
i can go anywhere with that- with a thousand dollars
can i took pictures or are we allowed to take pictures
okay
yah alright
then on the second day because i really love the sea i wanna go swimming right there
the singapore zoo in the afternoon
yah jealousy
okay
but i'm asking if the beach is free
yes
no i- what i said was i love reading books so- and i'm into literature so i want to go to museum and-
uh it's fine if we arrived there on the fourth
yes until sixth
sixth
so yes
actually it's uh- it's affordable
i see
how do i get there
alright
um marina frometan is that right
it is
so um is the travel fare for the shuttle included in the hotel accommodation
yes what i mean is-
so only for the travel itself
uh a thousand dollar- singaporean dollar is enough
because as you mentioned that i can enter the zoo for around sixty five to seventy five singaporean dollars right
so- yes
oh yah
oh really
alright so before- uh so after our tour uh will you- what's this
yes
because i was thinking that i will- i'll be needing a tourist guide and he will show me in this place or this or that
no i'm not
yes i don't
uh just walking from one place to another would be good
yah
rendezvous hotel
so what is that again
and up to what time
alright
and what are the rates on this hotel
yah i think- okay so this is not uh your popular tourist destination in singapore
because i'm planning to go there by april
and i'm glad that now you could show me around singapore and uh -
so this uh establishments are just newly opened
if you mind can you uh please show me that one
so it's a park actually
so this map is the whole of singapore

yah
yup
oh yes
yes he likes animals and uh he loves to play outside um
is it uh near in means of um public transportation
yup
can you please uh elaborate that for me
so if i have uh next time visit i will go during that uh those months
yup
yes i see
um i think um-
okay
is there eh oh
um i have a- just limited time to visit uh singapore
which one will be the highlight of the cruise
yes
okay

yup
okay

well thank you so much for that and you really helped me a lot
well i believe that's enough
well probably i will just try to call back to check if there's anything e-
so beautiful
i'm fascinated with the infrastructure you know how they build it
oh that's great
do you have a night market in singapore that we might-
so this is the different- various bars and restaurants that-
yes
oh that's good
along the river
so i would like to know since we're going on a travel
we're getting exhausted

one of the famous just you know just want to look at also
because you know this is my first time to go in there

alright good
um so how about the singapore historical places

beach mountain universal studio ethical places um may-
yah yes i mean delicacies food
yah i forgot it
do you have any idea
uh so how much the entrance for that
great
oh ten dollars

i don't know if i- i don't know my money will ke~ will be enough to- in singapore
i hope that's not that expensive
uh i guess they have do uh some packages right
how about the nightlife
yup home-grown
uh i thought it will be cost in hundred
oops!
because maybe four to five times in one year just to tour around singapore
hopefully
bye
hi um this is participant number twenty five
i'm pretty sure my daughter is gonna love that because she loves animals really
will there be boat rides available
but they don't like- um these orang-utans that you've shown me here they don't like um grab the food on your plate when you're having breakfast do they
i'm looking at the pictures and i am thinking of the activities that you know we'd probably do when we get there
yup
alright
i see
you have like cultural shows there
can you show me that too
well i might just you know sign up for a what you call that a standard seat and then bring my own cushion or something
hm so how long has it been running there
and this happens like every day
okay
the cartier or something
i'm really just at the planning stage right now
what about wednesday maybe
so-
okay that will do
of course
then how much is that again fifty eight dollars
so the food there is good huh
what other food do you you know usually help yourself to
but those are- you- mostly chinese food nothing-
and how far is that gonna be from the hotel
oh my goodness so you really must love it right
i think i better get one of those
yah
they're actually nice in the home and they say that they bring i don't know luck or something
yup
maybe a little chili but not too much
sounds like fun
i hope to see you there
yah
would you happen to know when uh one-
but then i'm not sure where to go 'cause-
okay
okay
yah
okay
okay
yes
okay
let's say your laws in singapore that i should abide by
sure
okay
yah
so it would be a good walk
okay
and um where would four hundred eighty dollars get me um for shopping in singapore
and what would you suggest um would be a good souvenir to buy let's say when i get back
is it something else different
that's a peking duck right
so it's more of the broth of the chicken uh that's the same thing that you use for cooking the rice is that it
and what else would you suggest
um something else authentic or something authentic or different
okay
so the- okay
um yes
okay
or even two days right
i can come back to singapore and- just come back to singapore and try out that salad
okay
and um what else would you suggest that i do um aside from the f one race and then trying out the singaporean delicacies
okay
and would your- what's this
um is that a five-minute or ten-minute walk
okay
so i can definitely take pictures as long as i turn off the flash
okay
and uh do they also sell souvenirs in the museum
okay
i definitely enjoy singapore walking
okay
okay
yah that's fine
okay
bye
oh that's sad
so i have to find someone else to babysit my baby
because uh we planned to go around
um i like a bit of luxury
yah
i also like you know uh a lot of uh beaches
oh that's something i have to talk with about my- you know to talk about with my boyfriend
well so it sounds like that uh hotel near the chinese restaurant is the winner
that sounds pretty great
alright they have laundry
and uh air-conditioned rooms uh mini bars telephone shower internet access
uh is that like uh free wi-fi
no and that something i'm- alright that something i have to enquire with the hotel

uh with the same words
exactly not bad
can you tell me the difference between the two what they offer
oh sounds like an awesome place
oh wow
yes
okay yah he can just watch from afar
so this uh- this admission it's only good for just one trip and can i use all- uh do i have to use the ticket within the day itself
um pu~
uh okay
i like the place then so it's-
um yah just swimming
and oh uh also a spa
wow
like where wo~ like how far would the bus uh stop from where you know we're supposed to go on the beach
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
that's definitely i must
yap
alright
good afternoon
that's correct
hi
relatively young
but i'm not really that young
that's correct
but i don't mind going to places in singapore that are um already popular to a lot of tourists that go there
but um uh since i'm actually currently interested in sentosa
okay so um i'm not gonna miss it right
will i have a guide
but have you seen uh how they actually go about the competition
okay
excellent
but i like uh the environment when people still have uh still can get aloud even if you know late in the evening
no problem
'cause that's one thing i would definitely like to try
yes
so um-
well ghosts are different
but i don't like the fact that uh it's outside
alright
are there-
that's right
yah
good
yes we will be there
oh good question
okay
good fortune to feast on good food
but um i've tried a few indian food as well but um what's the other
is it also good for dinner or um dessert
yes
okay
alright
so that's thirty-five dollars let's say give or take right
okay
okay
what is that
that's not very nice
'cause uh i heard from my friends who actually visited india that they see a lot of um monkeys or baboons running around uh where they're staying you know
right
okay
okay
hello miss lynnette
but uh let me just clarify this what do you mean by hari raya
uh but do they have any kind of a special cuisine or- in that festival are they allowed to eat
uh okay business as usual
is it possible that you can show me the image and so that i could really get the idea of the dresses the womens are wearing and for the boys also if that is okay
uh okay
yes and the model is very beautiful too
but i'm really curious about this deepavali thing
you just told me that it is a festival of light right
is that- is- how would you describe deepavali in- like for an image something like that
so how do you call the men's costume or let's say natural dress or normal dress for the men
how do you say- kurta right
ah okay kurta
is that fried rice or java rice
uh the chicken
okay
is that a special kind of chicken
uh hm
oh well that's good
i want to taste it now
i gain so much information about that
so for example i'm in singapore and i wanted to see that christmas celebration in orchard road what would be the ideal transportation i would use
wow
yes that's good that's-
it starts from what time to- till what time
uh hm
uh okay
and for this grand central hotel like you are gonna show me as of this moment what would be the events that is happening in that particular hotel
a walk away
yes
yes february
of orchard road yes
bay as in around the water
i mean do they have gyms like swimming pools or they do have billiard tables or what are- in particular do they have any sports to offer
oh yes that one
so meaning to say it's like a- what did they show there
so every-
so that is four months
factory
why for men
uh okay
yes for the party people
i wanted to stay in one place where in there is a lot of happenings that's what i'm looking for in a place
so i can check this one time to time
what would be the other disco or club near the marina bay
drink cheap okay
wow
yah
thank you very much miss lynnette have- i had fun really with the tour that you gave me and have a nice day
thank you
uh yah i'm planning to go to singapore
yah well i was thinking of i will- i'm planning to propose to her there
yes i guess so
and it could be just the two of us
so would the- would a mall be close to uh the park
since you know i'm going to propose and that would mean i would be uh having to save money
let's see
is that correct
everything-
okay
so- yah that sounds good
i kinda like the images that you showed me a while ago regarding traders hotel
that sounds- that actually sounds better than my plan
so spa first before the garden
this actually looks good
that's- it's kind of out of context
that really does look exotic
at esplanade okay
then during the afternoon i would take her to the spa
then at night i would take her to porcupine
the-
that lion statue- thing
okay s~
yah okay
are we supposed to like go uh swimming or diving
in the daytime
okay
so i'm going to be able to visit all the buildings because it's close-by
but the shopping that's what my girlfriend would be there for
if you know what i mean
okay
uh anyway um for our second day what do you think would be uh something unique
frie~ prawn mee recipe
okay
okay
so i guess that would mean that my first and second day is fully booked
since i've got my first and second day booked i'm hoping that all the suggestions that you have given me are your personal choices you know
since uh you're female and all
okay
uh no but i think my sister did
so- yah that's good
okay
good afternoon
yap
oh that's nice to hear
so we're checking out on the eleventh
so how much would that be
okay
okay
ah i see
i'm not really sure
yes
um so uh how much would uh our- can i have a look at um your hotel offers
okay
um i just needed picture of perhaps um does that hotel have a dining area
'cause we might have um our dinner when we arrive
ah so you don't have elevators on that hotel
yah
wow!
um coming from the airport of course um i'm gonna take the subway or the east-west line
that's nice
yah but that would be um too lengthy of a time to stay at the theatre
um hm fifteen minutes
or ten thirty and then uh we can walk going to merlion from here
okay
across the road of our hotel
um there is a museum where you have bottles of water on the wall because um they've said that um water was very um- a very important resource way back then as it you actually import that
um can i get um tokens like a souvenir items from those shops
that's nice
um for us to take our dinner
two to three hundred dollars for the both of us
um anything else that you think would not be too costy but still going to be very romantic for the both of us
well as i've said um for the entire trip um we're only working on one thousand singaporean dollars
doesn't cost too much
yap so i'm left with four hundred
two hundred three-
so you know we don't wanna be too tight
i don't know what that hotel or what that place is but um i have seen pictures of a floating building
uh you know what you've been very helpful jeanne

that okay i didn't notice that
is it very hot
uh what about the uh facilities

okay that sounds interesting
okay that sounds interesting
um i think i would love to uh stay there in fragrance

i really don't want to have any uh package deals huh
okay
and then i would have to uh pay another three dollars for the entrance fee that is if i uh i mean that is if i wanted uh a quick ride right
well you mention three dollars so is there another different rate
i have to uh say this to you uh it's quite expensive
um what does it cover
