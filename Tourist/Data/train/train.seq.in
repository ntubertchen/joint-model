'cause there's a theme park here
the last time my kids and i were there we spend so much on games you know they need to spend for a token so that they can win a prize or something like that
inside the studio

okay oh uh remember this kind of uh expo then the comex and the it show and i believe yah
it's uh available on facebook i can keep track of their uh- their activities yes okay
so that's settled then hmm so that-
i love electronics but mainly- what else
okay
thirty three degrees uh celcius or centigrade uh can be hot but it's uh similar to uh what we experience here in my country during the summer season
that's what uh-
uh so i have two destinations uh funan centre and possibly uh the convention centre where co~ the comex and it show are held
yes
but there- if there is no uh expo going on then it's gonna be uh like a mall right
shops
mainly for clothing um hm
oh my brother is so i think you know i can uh add to my shopping list uh maybe a few camera peripherals and attachments
yes
okay
uh huh okay
uh huh i'll take note of that yes
uh sa~ it's near santa grand hotel yes
uh huh north bridge road
i see
right
i see okay
okay when it comes to food do you have uh anything listed about filipino restaurants near the area
lucky~ but it's not actually a place it's more of an event like it happens-
yes i can see lucky plaza when the there's a map yes
well sunday
sunday and- is there a particular time or just during that the whole day
sunday
eh yah
but yah
maybe you know if- ever i get homesick- just for the day it's for-
just for the day it's for-
oh yah
okay
uh it's a trivia for me
alright
hm if i go- if i'm including sunday in my travel list is- i'll also go to church- uh the christian church
is there a christian church nearby
just christian
like- it can be baptist but yah
not really catholic but christian- i think there's a new life christian centre uh in singapore
i am not sure i'm sorry
yah christian centre or- the biggest here in the philippines uh we do have that in several sites as well accross the country
that i- okay
i see
christian
oh
i see
hm is this a church now
brunch gathering- okay yes it is christian
and does it is it uh nearby or do i have to travel by bus
and does it is it uh nearby or do i have to travel by bus

okay
yah okay
alright
sunday i got alright
sunday i got alright
church
alright got it
yes one eight three-
uh huh
we're directly opposite the ocbc bank
oh so that's a bit too far i guess
that's good- that's okay
oh by the way-
i'll keep that in mind
i'm listing all of the uh places that i've asked about uh from the start of our conversation here okay hm alright
forty five minutes so if this- i've i missed the first service it's about thirty okay yah
so i need to-
i need to be on the bus at ten thirty i guess
to be safe
oh yah
how is the traffic in uh singapore on sundays
is it-
i mean i have- great
i see
i see
three minutes
but uh does the traffic get pretty congested on sundays or not really
that's good
so the forty five-minute travel time by bus is pretty much uh smooth ride without-
traffic jams and things like that
okay
so the farthest place so far in my online list is the church
the night~
but what kind of place is that jeanne
ah okay
like all of it the nocturnal animals can be viewed there right
hm i love- mainly i love those geek stuff i mentioned earlier

so five days right
so five days right
so five day- will do
but if i only have like a budget of maybe right a thousand dollars would it get me to a lot of places though
so maybe not too oh
maybe i can just buy some souvenir right stuff- but not really shop because i mean i don't have a lot of like extra money to bring with me so i think i can only bring a piece of thousand dollars and that's it
because i was thinking like maybe that's a good advice for me for us to downgrade our hotel and then try to like uh you know take mrt
because i was thinking like maybe that's a good advice for me for us to downgrade our hotel and then try to like uh you know take mrt
and- yes and don't shop a lot
just you know just enjoy the place
because there's a lot of places that we can- go to in singapore right
and what about- the food

it's just not really that far
in- okay that sounds wonderful
you know what
you know what
okay
i like to eat curry
okay
i read some- i read it right
oh
oh
and- you're okay to go right
for three to four dollars and you know
okay
okay
okay
i'm gonna try that because it says here top must try dishes
fish head curry six votes
oh i'm gonna try that when i get there
it looks-
but not too hot
and also i- ms uh jeanne i also have one question
are singa~ yah are singaporeans uh friendly people
are you guys friendly or- i mean can we ask question maybe if we're lost
can we approach you know just approach you and say "excuse me can you tell us where is-" or can you give us directions
are you guys approachable and friendly too
okay
okay
so maybe i can say pardon or excuse me i'm kind of lost can you give us direction going to like- orchard place or- okay
i'll put that
okay
okay
okay
okay
oh so i don't have to like you know shell out change everytime i take the mrt right
okay
okay
okay
okay
so how much is it
is it- ten dollars twenty dollars
oh yes
oh yes
so it is like twelve dollars-
ten dollars and five dollars right
wow
that's a lot of um discount if i you know buy it in singpost- outlets
uh okay
so it's just like a denomination right
okay
oh okay
so i can use it and then everytime i use it right
so there will be like-my balance will not be as you know like twelve dollars from twelve dollars
it goes down- to ten eight seven- until there's not- you know there is nothing left right
okay
oh
okay
okay
i'm gonna go- to universal studio
maybe try forest adventure
go to- little india and go to along orchard road and rangoon
is it rangoon
okay
so-
chinatown right
okay
okay

so it's advisable to stay like five days right
max
to be able to enjoy it
okay
if i still have money left i have to go into a lot of places we've talked about
i guess right why not
okay
so that's about it
so um perhaps i'll go to your country and i think it's a very beautiful country
and-
i look forward

how old are you
if you don't mind how old- how young are you
if you don't mind how old- how young are you

that's good news so unless if i'm going there um for two days and let say friday saturday the best time to go to universal studios would be on the friday
friday and then just go to the beaches on a saturday okay

okay
i see
okay and it's- and the hotel is walking distance from the beach right
that's good
okay
and what are the rates like for this hotel
and i guess we can do uh we can probably book hypothetically for august uh seventeen to eighteen just to see if they have available rooms on that-
okay yah
so it is a friday
oh that's good
it's not bad
right
okay
right and um yes if we do uh decide to got the mainland uh what can we do there
yah that's- so that's why i was planning to go to the mainland
but now your telling me that it's actually on sentosa island
so now if we go the mainland what can we do there
what can we see
i guess um if uh actually sentosa would be probably for me and for my son
but if we go the mainland i guess that will be for my wife
but if we go the mainland i guess that will be for my wife
and she likes to shop so where can we to go shopping
and she likes to shop so where can we to go shopping
and she likes to shop so where can we to go shopping
okay
okay
alright
oh i see
she actually likes to go to bargain shops
uh are there any places here or roads where they have bargain like for shops or the market
far east
okay
okay
um uh war museums
not too much war museums but if you have any science museums or a technology museums
my son is more interested in science actually
that's good
okay
i see
it looks pretty interesting
um how much is the entrance fee to this science centre
okay yah
alright
um actually you mention a lot of trips uh via the mrt
uh is it fairly simple to take the mrt to different locations or-
that i can understand
okay
good
that's good
okay
okay that's good
and uh most of the shops the locations and things to go to it is accessible via the mrt is that right
alright and how much will it cost me to take the mrt in one direction
okay
two dollars
two dollars
okay
uh the standard ticket and what's that
per trip
uh is there uh a ticket like an all-day where i can use that and i can go anywhere i want uh with that ticket no
per trip basis okay
right
nine dollars
nine dollars
five dollars for three to six okay
so that's eighteen for five twenty three okay
so that's eighteen for five twenty three okay
i see
alright and that's not included in the entrance fee right
additional ten dollars and it's seven dollars for kids
additional ten dollars and it's seven dollars for kids
three to twelve years old
three to twelve years old

uh and going back to the resort hotel
uh if i remember correctly it was around four hundred fifty dollars is that right
uh if i remember correctly it was around four hundred fifty dollars is that right
and that's per night

okay
alright
oh okay
oh is uh um are street food is available on sentosa island
alright and this uh food court on sentosa island uh they serve street food just like on the mainland

is that like desert
yah
alright
white radish
breakfast lunch or dinner
so the whole day

yah i think we do
actually um one of our things that we do is uh we try to taste as many of the street or the local foods as possible
and i think this fried carrot cake would be one of them if we do decide to go to singapore
anything else that we can try
anything exotic or uh maybe challenging to try
yah
oh okay
turtle soup
i see
okay and uh what else can we expect uh from the street food yah
um hm okay and what's that
okay

and if things get a bit too maybe strange for my son uh my son really likes fast food
is there uh- what are the fast food restaurants available in singapore
okay
alright
alright pretty standard and stuff okay
alright so um i'm guessing uh with the accommodations uh with the food and the entrance fees uh maybe around seven to may be eight hundred dollars us dollars
alright so um i'm guessing uh with the accommodations uh with the food and the entrance fees uh maybe around seven to may be eight hundred dollars us dollars
is a good amount of money to have uh as a budget
okay that's good
so it's-
right
okay sounds interesting
let see anything else
oh so there is rice underneath and it's uh cooked along with the meat
and this is only for four dollars
oh that's good
so the open air is just fine
alright and this restaurant is on bugis bugis street or bugis what is that
right
orchid road
right
okay
i see alright
oh i have one more very important questions
and the water there was not very uh potable
ri~ when we actually drink water there we got sick

uh i think it's around two thousand or more than two thousand singaporean dollar the value of that
yes
yes i think it is
but it's fine but- because i really want to travel
i really want to go to singapore because i want to see how beautiful it is
actually i'm into- i love animals so i wanna go to the zoo if there is
oh which is the best zoo in singapore

wildlife reserve is that right
how much is the fee

so it's one of the prohibitions in your country that we don't have to litter anywhere right
so what if i don't know any rules about that
i'm throwing pieces of litter every- anywhere
yes because it's- actually we- i am aware that singapore is the cleanest city in the world

upon entering is two dollars
uh huh
yes
but i'm asking if the beach is free
what about the cottage

um well you see my husband and i will be celebrating our wedding anniversary coming may and we're sort of thinking um going on a tour in asia maybe
um some time this may
no not yet
um well um one of the places that we'd really like to go to for this tour will probably be singapore
i have heard a lot of good things about it and maybe that's a very good place to start
so for this particular tour since we're gonna probably bring along our daughter with us we're sort of thinking um probably going to a theme park maybe
um she's four
yah
uh hm i totally understand
will there be anything else that you would probably recommend aside from that
will there be anything else that you would probably recommend aside from that
oh i am very interested about the night safari can you tell more about that please

so what time does the night safari usually open
yup i surely can

so that sounds really interesting
um will there be like activities um like feeding the animals or riding the small animals maybe
oh that sounds interesting
so um what i'm seeing right now these are different places right
so um what i'm seeing right now these are different places right
okay
um for all of them
wow
um can you tell me more about um the river safari
um okay
so what other activities do you have um in the river safari
oh i see
that sounds really nice
i'm-
so this is just opened last january
oh i see
it seems to me as if this is gonna be a very big place
it seems to me as if this is gonna be a very big place
oh my goodness
oh yes please
oh yes please
well i can just imagine that right
um well definitely i'd like to see um any of these places that you've just shown me 'cause like i said my kid just loves animals so this is probably something i have to put on my agenda when i go to singapore
yah
right
uh would you know how much this is gonna cost to have a package ticket for all of these places that you've just shown me
that will work
make sense
yes i definitely am
yah definitely
yup
hm i see
yup i'm definitely there
i'll probably take a video of her
oh yes
oh yes
yup
yes ma'am
alright i got that
alright got that
uh hm okay
so i was about to ask you a question but i'm actually reading the answer from what you're showing me
so it says there that visits to the three park need not be in one day so i got my answer just right there
right
okay
um i think i'm good
um i think i'm good
yup
i'm okay with the zoo
what about um cultural shows
okay
right
"cause i was thinking since we're there anyway might as well experience the culture right and see how different it is from where i come from
okay
okay
yup
and there's probably music there too huh
and there's probably music there too huh
um yup seven forty
ei~ yup
i see
i might check that out too
um i see
so what's the difference between your premium seats and your standard seats
so what's the difference between your premium seats and your standard seats
alright
can you show that to me as well
oh no that's fine
you're doing a great job jeanne don't worry
well like i said well i really want to see it would be something that you know not the every day thing that we usually see here
and this happens like every day
alright
okay
that's nice
yah
their break- their vacation maybe
okay
hm i'm looking at the prices
so hundred eighty eight is probably the nearest seat to the stage right
and that's the same fee for let say or do they admit kids like my daughter's age
alright
okay i got that
hm i think i'm gonna have my agenda full
can you recommend shops maybe that you have
okay
yup
um nothing in particular maybe
um i was thinking of just you know um checking the shops out and see- you know what could probably be in~ of interest for me and my husband or my kid
i hope you get to talk with my husband
yup it looks very nice
right on top of it
is that an infinity pool
well don't go near the edge then
stay away from it
so what's your favourite shop jeanne
so what's your favourite shop jeanne
um what about jewellery
uh hm i can
um i think i'm good
um maybe we can talk about the hotel next
uh no not yet
i will-
ah okay
'cause i would rather have as much information as i can at this point before we finally decide
okay
uh hm may
uh hm may
right may
right may
will there be available rooms
um probably not a weekend uh maybe midweek or something
um one room
yup
yah
but this hotel is safe right
i mean-
being a- being a very old hotel it's not gonna crumble down on me is it
yup
okay
hm that's interesting
that's the one with the bathroom that you were talking about earlier
but unfortunately i am
it's really nice jeanne
it's just that i think with the price of the junior suite i might not have enough money to go to the places that i want to go to
it's just that i think with the price of the junior suite i might not have enough money to go to the places that i want to go to
um hm that's for one person right
that's for one day
right
so that's gonna be around four hundred already plus you know the add-ons
or maybe downgrade on the room
what about the other rooms can we check those out as well
how is it different from what's that superior double
yah let's take a look
right
okay
so maybe uh-
i'll maybe go for the deluxe room then and we'll definitely go to the um zoo for my kid
right
um well do you have other pictures
because from the picture that i looked at earlier um-
yup
um maybe i'll put the safari thing on top of my list for my daughter's sake
'cause i was always- also thinking that two days might not be enough to you know to cover everything
hm but uh- but i see that the price for the kid is uh different it's only thirty eight dollars
so i think i have money for the show then
wouldn't that be too far or do you think that's just right
okay
so you just buy that card and then you use it for your bus and train rides correct
so how much do these ez cards cost
thirty dollars for one person
hm i see
so the thirty dollar value that- do you think that will be enough for the entire duration for the trip or um how much just one person usually spend going around
so i need to get two of those correct
ah alright
okay
right
um any you know um food places that you'd probably recommend we can check out before we go-
anything particular you have in mind
oh i love it
not bad
what's your favourite
yup
and so this is like close to where i'm gonna stay if ever
i see
yah i was just looking at the picture and i can see that i could probably you know- i couldn't count the stalls there it's probably a very long lane of stalls right
um but i'm not really a fan of curry
what about other food aside from indian food
what about other food aside from indian food
european food maybe western food or thai food do you have thai food there
no i don't
you have like-
smith street okay
and what about the prices of the food there
do you go there a lot too
oh so it's just like a night market of some sort
for food yah
oh i see
there
alright that sounds good
really
do you have pictures of that shop that you're just talking about
'cause-
ah okay
what about bazaars do you have like bazaars there as well
so how long have you been doing this jeanne
wow
could-
well that's nice to know i really don't like crowds at all
oh that's nice
and they are not too expensive are they
that's so nice
i just might uh do that
right
i could just imagine
hm that's nice
what are those things hanging there in the middle of the picture
wow
but of course it's available even if it's not the new year correct
okay
is that something that's made of paper or-
and hand painted no not really
wow that's so nice
i better get one of that
okay
and the designs were like abstract or are they supposed to represent something
hm okay
that's interesting
do you make them
wow colourful
training chopsticks or some sort
i might get one myself
right
well i was just kidding
it looks delicious
yup
not too hot right
oh so it's a little bony
yup
oh that's nice
alright
so i think i got everything that i need thank you so much jeanne
i think i will definitely enjoy my stay
alright thank you jeanne
bye
hello
uh this is participant number 26
and my name is eric
and my name is eric
okay
i'm doing good
i'm doing good
how about you
yah
uh jeanne i was just calling in to um ask for your assistance
'cause um i have a plan to visit singapore
um i still don't have any fix date but then i was looking in to going to singapore during the night race for the formula one
would you happen to know when uh one-
third week of september
um i'll be all by myself
and i'm also looking into uh being there um during the qualifying race
okay
and um i'm just looking into- um i'm just looking for saturday and sunday
uh but then i don't have any plans of staying there for three days just for two days
uh but then i don't have any plans of staying there for three days just for two days
uh yes
just um saturday and then uh sunday evening
and then maybe fly out uh back to the- um back to the philippines um after the race
uh-
um if it would still be possible if i had time because i'm not exactly sure about um the schedule for the qualifying race and then what time the actual race starts
but then if i have time in between the qualifying and uh what's the- the qualifying race and then the um the night race itself then i pretty much can visit different areas in singapore
okay
okay
yah um 'cause i only have a budget of one thousand singapore dollars
um wo~ is that good enough for the qualifying race alone or would it also cover the race itself
for the two days
how much is that gonna cost
okay
okay
okay
okay
i think the grandstand would do
um yah
yes
and uh which area would be the starting line
okay
no problem
and would that- um that would be for the qualifying and for the night race itself
or just for the qualifying race
sounds good
um during the night race you close down the s~ uh you close your streets for the race itself
okay
so uh for the- if i buy seats um in the pitt area- uh in front of the pitt area that would be the one over a thousand dollars- a thousand singaporean dollars
okay
and that-
okay
so would you suggest that there'd be more accident happening during straight lines rather than the-
okay
that i think that sounds good
um it's two hundred fifty something dollars right
um it's two hundred fifty something dollars right
okay
so um would that include the taxes or is it um the taxes aren't- it's not part of the two fifty dollars
so um would that include the taxes or is it um the taxes aren't- it's not part of the two fifty dollars
okay
and you also take um american express over um as payment right
um yah i think that the two hundred fifty um dollar ticket prices is good enough for me so that still leaves me with seven fifty
um so that i can go there if i have free time
i can you know go around singapore and possibly shop
um what would you suggest
uh let's say for two- 'cause i would want- as much as possible i would wanna have more money- um more pocket money for shopping
okay
um yah
um but then if i look at a place to stay and i would want it to be secure and safe
okay
okay
um yes
um i would prefer to have my own bathroom inside the room
and um it comes with an air conditioning unit
okay
that sounds good
if i book in advance uh do i get a discount or would it still be the regular rate
okay
and um since this is my first time uh that i'll be in singapore um are there several precautions that um i should be aware of
okay
so twenty eight dollars a night
so twenty eight dollars a night
okay
yes
alright
okay
um do you have anything that would be more than- uh that's not gonna go over fifty dollars
but then it's a single room
yah
a room
okay
'cause i wa~ 'cause i plan how um to make use of five hundred dollars for the pocket money
and then the two hundred- the two hundred fifty dollars for the um for the room accommodation- for the hotel accommodation
okay
okay
and for two hundred fifty dollars uh do i get two nights or just one night
okay
um yes
'cause i plan to be there by sa~ maybe saturday morning
and then watch the qualifying race uh maybe the second qualifying race
okay
okay
um i actually have a question
uh would you suggest that i buy a ticket for the f one race and then um get a separate hotel accommodation
or do i get a hotel accommodation that um that is very near the- um uh what's this
so even though if i book in advance
let's say a few weeks from now
okay
okay
okay
so this is a one-star hotel
okay
um would you suggest that the hotel i take uh be near um the racing venue or far from the racing venue wherein i would have- i would still have to take the train
um yes
okay
okay
yah
i believe it is um- if it includes a short walk that would be fine
i believe it is um- if it includes a short walk that would be fine
so i can enjoy the scenery as well
so i can enjoy the scenery as well
um yes
yes i am
okay
okay
yah
that- i believe that's a uh it sounds like a really good deal
um just another question with the hotel reservation
does it come with free breakfast
okay
and- um yes i do
so under five dollars for a good meal
it's gonna cost me more
okay
okay
so i think i'm gonna enjoy singapore if i eat outside of the hotel
december of this year
december of this year
okay
okay
yah
um yes
okay
and um where would four hundred eighty dollars get me um for shopping in singapore
i'm not exactly sure what i'm gonna get
um but then what i've heard is that um the electronics or the gadgets in singapore its price significantly lower in comparison to the other asian markets
and um is there also flea market in singapore
okay
okay
and what would you suggest um would be a good souvenir to buy let's say when i get back
and how much do they usually cost
okay
that's good
and um-
yah go ahead
yes
so is that a- um is this- is that a food market
okay
okay
okay
and what singapore- uh what is singapore's um food delicacy
um is it chinese
is it indian
or what would you suggest that i eat uh that would make a big difference or that would make me remember singapore for their food
um i would wanna try something very different um that is uh none western in nature
um i would wanna try something very different um that is uh none western in nature
i would want it to be something that is authentic of singapore
i would want it to be something that is authentic of singapore
that's a peking duck right
oh okay
um yes
okay
okay
okay
so it's more of-
okay
okay
and how much would that cost
is it- would it be a cup of rice or is it just how- like how many servings
okay
okay
so that's one delicacy that i can try out maybe when i get there
okay
and what else would you suggest
okay
and would you suggest i eat from a restaurant or from the side street vendors
and would you suggest i eat from a restaurant or from the side street vendors
okay
okay
okay
and this is something that's only available in the restaurant or do they also sell this in the side street
okay
okay
so um what's that
mantau
is it mantau or mantou
okay
so um and the mantou is the one that they use for the dumplings right
the bread
okay
okay
wow
that's expensive
and um that wouldn't be impolite right
clams
okay
and this is also priced at forty dollars or lower
and this is also priced at forty dollars or lower
okay
okay
okay
okay
um do they raise their prices during race day
or is it um- do they have a fixed amount for the food
that's good
okay
okay
okay
um i just have another question
okay
hm okay
that's good
uh that sounds really good
and um is- i just wanna get a bigger picture
would four hundred dollars go along way for two days in singapore
would four hundred dollars go along way for two days in singapore
yes
for-
okay
hm okay
so four hundred dollars
that's good enough for food and then for shopping
ten dollars
okay
and uh does singapore also provide or serve ethnic food
okay
but then is there something that is um something that would really describe yah the food in singapore or let's say um it's singaporean brand type of food
is there something like that
okay
so uh they don't serve that kind of salad on let's say during september or maybe this month
okay
maybe i can- what's this
and that's uh in february
very interesting
and um what else would you suggest that i do um aside from the f one race and then trying out the singaporean delicacies
is there anything else that i can do
let's say if-
um yes
but that's also one thing that i'm considering
but then is there anything else that i can do to make my first trip to singapore memorable
and funan centre is- is this a mall
would your sub courts and your- what's this
your supreme court also be in the city hall or is it in a different place
okay
but um is that a restricted area for tourist to take photographs of
okay
okay
and um where is jumbo located
the jumbo restaurant
is it along side boat quay
is it along side boat quay
so um would you consider that a short walk or is it a long walk
okay
um is that a five-minute or ten-minute walk
that's good
the-
then that would be the one that they commercialise or they show in the history channel
i'm sorry
um it was- is that the old british office
okay
okay
that's good
and can tour~ um would i be allowed as a tourist to take photographs of the museum
okay
okay
or can i enter the museum without paying anything
okay
um yes
okay
okay
well that's really- that's an affordable price
hm okay
that's good
okay
sounds really good
okay
i definitely consider that
so i can eat the chili crab
i just wanna make sure that i get everything correct
so there's a chili crab there's a chicken rice
and then i can also eat curry in the indian um- uh what's this
in the- what do you call that
the indian city
okay
and my hotel is near- uh it's a walk it's walking distance from the race venue and the race venue is also near the museum
and the restaurant for the chili crab is also walking distance
and that's a hundred and forty dollars
okay
i wouldn't mind
um yes
i would definitely appreciate it
um yes
yah
and your mrt map- uh what is your mrt
how does one train ride cost
okay
okay
hm changi

um yes
okay
that's very affordable
that's the river

okay
okay
and the marina bay is also part of the racing line
okay
okay
and this mr syste~ mrt system that you're showing me it covers entire singapore
okay
and your bus system also has- uh does it follow a strict schedule
okay
and what's this
uh your bus system and your mrt system is it a twenty four hour transportation system or are there- is there a schedule for both of them
okay
and is there a place in singapore that um uh i should avoid visiting tha- that's un~ uh that's considered an unsafe area
and is there a place in singapore that um uh i should avoid visiting tha- that's un~ uh that's considered an unsafe area

uh yah
i've actually uh planning a trip uh to singapore soon
uh some time in april
and um uh it's just going to be me my boyfriend and i'm going to carry like a small dog with me
uh i can't live anywhere without it
so i wanna know how that's going to be possible
yes
oh i see
well- okay i'm not sure
i don't think there'll be a problem um well 'cause me and my boyfriend are planning to go there around mid-april
uh whatever is available
and we planned to stay there for a week
so um i have really-
i have re~ yes
well okay
that i think we've been discussing
uh he is- my boyfriend is on the uh cheap side
yah
but uh i wanna make sure that we're both comfortable
um as long as the room has everything we need air-conditioned
and you know savour all the delicacies that singapore has to offer
um okay
uh i have about a thousand uh singapore dollars that i- as my budget
uh i have about a thousand uh singapore dollars that i- as my budget
um well 'cause i'm not sure about ho~ you know how the rate is over there
um well 'cause i'm not sure about ho~ you know how the rate is over there
and uh how much we're going to need for you know to visit all the sightseeing go around eating
possibly um go on tours
uh okay
yes
uh with a tv a hot shower and service- room service
yap
yah
something that's uh you know affordable by middle class families
so like aside from just the food in singapore
what else is there any to
um well i like uh um animals pretty much
um i like you know i wanna see all kinds of animals that you don't get to see in the states
um aside from food
uh theme parks if there're any
and uh going to nightclubs where there is a band
oh and- yes and shopping is a must
yah uh hm
alright
yah bu~ out of the way like is it somewhere- what do you mean out of the way
okay
well it would be great if it's close to where you know there are places to eat
so we don't have to walk so far
okay
'cause he is a big fan of chinese food but i like both
and i also like indian food a lot more than i do chinese food
so is there anything else that's in between
yes
yah
uh do you know what kind of uh amenities that the hotel offers
uh do you know what kind of uh amenities that the hotel offers
yes i can
uh hm
okay
alright
uh is that like uh free wi-fi
yap
i ca- oh in the room itself
okay
alright
not bad
that sounds like a big deal
they did win an award
yah it does look like
uh from the picture that i saw
okay
yah
that would be great
so like how far is it from the airport
oh okay
so i have to take
is it like uh subway or is it um one of those uh skyway trains
alright
okay so that little uh inn is where the hotel is
okay so that little uh inn is where the hotel is
uhhm
okay
okay
that i would have been worried if it was a red light district
okay
um hm okay
oh i see alright
so you will just show the price instead of saying it to them
i see
alright would then make sense
wait
what's it called again
it's uh singlish
i wonder when i heard it i was thinking okay
i wonder when i heard it i was thinking okay
it sounds like they're singing english
that's pretty cool
oh but do all them sounds like you
i mean yah you speak english pretty well
i think there was a song about that
that's interesting
i should look for that
oh okay
cool alright
oh anyway um i just realised 'cause i was looking at the dates that i was planning to trip for
and um apparently there is a conflict
um boyfriend just texted me and he says we can only go for about one or two days
um boyfriend just texted me and he says we can only go for about one or two days
that's quite a short tour
then yah
exactly not bad
but it's still such a short trip
um yes
there- is there like a zoo or uh some sort of uh a farm
oh is there a difference
can you tell me the difference between the two what they offer
wow
so how far is that from the hotel
okay
okay
well 'cause my boyfriend is more interested at- like interacting with the animals rather than taking pictures with them
okay
uh that would be great
uh that would be great
it just an- it sounds like a great thing a package
so um like uh what are the prices for you know if it's like a whole day thing
so um like uh what are the prices for you know if it's like a whole day thing
or um do we just have to pay upon entrance and then we have to pay for other attractions within that area
sure
sure
so that would be convenient
okay
wow
what is that
uh a mole rat
uh that looks quite scary
it's the first time ever i've seen a mole- a naked mole rat
wow
um of course not
uh any kind of wildlife uh shouldn't be touch their you know
it's great to see them from afar but- obviously we should-
oh so we're allowed to handle the snakes
oh so we're allowed to handle the snakes
like-
okay
okay my boyfriend has a fear of snakes and uh i like them
so um and i want him with me
i don't think he wanna go with a you know a pit full snakes
that would just wouldn't make sense
yah
okay yah he can just watch from afar
that is cute
yah
uh do we get like some sort of um uh interaction like with the snakes
do we get interaction with any of the uh safari animals
oh i see uh that would yah that sounds like a good plan
like um so we fill up the whole day and don't have to waste any of it
where can we buy the food for the animals
where can we buy the food for the animals
eh uh in the same place
oh yah
oh yes please
why is it the night safari and not the daytime safari
is there a reason
yap
okay so thirty-two singapore dollars for each person
and includes-
yah
yah
that'll would be- that's not bad
i would consider the package
yah i- oh okay
or can i use it on separate days
oh i see
okay
oh alright
yes
pretty cool
yah it's not bad- it's not bad of a deal
yah it's not bad- it's not bad of a deal
wow
so i can spend the rest on food
and then uh there's also uh transportation to cover
can you show me like uh other shopping areas that are uh close-
i heard about that
it's just- it's like a really long street right
it's the first time i ever heard of an underpass in singapore
that's- is that like a recent-
those upscale brands
well i'm not much of the upscale person
uh speaking more of uh less upscale areas or shopping malls
yes
sure
oh yah
i've heard about that
um the wholesale they called it
last time i went to bangkok
god they were telling me like if you buy at least three items in the store you get discounts
yah
i can see how that works and attracts people
so you give one of those friends huh
alright
yah it's customary
like uh if you buy those little uh knick knacks
i'm not a big fan of key chains
but more of things that if people can actually use
oh what about like uh tea
yap
oh okay
so that's supposed to be um near the hotel
yah okay
i like the place then so it's-
i like the place then so it's-
i like the place then so it's-

yah
oh so they have their own bus in sentosa island then
okay
well um so like do these beaches have like uh theme park or water park
like with the slides in the- um like an indoor surf pool or wave
okay
so they don't have that

yah i ho~ so we can catch up and then uh how we get- go to uh fish spa together
yes
alright
goodbye
okay
yap
do i ask about my time
it's not really
hello
hi jeanne
um i'm participant number thirty
my name is dodie victor
um no that's actually d as in delta o oscar d i e
um no that's actually d as in delta o oscar d i e
that's correct
alright
hi
so jeanne i was actually looking forward to um visit a country in the southeast asian region
and i'm currently considering singapore
um i wonder if you can help me out
um i'm actually thirty four years old
um it's just going to be me and my fiancée
um it's just going to be me and my fiancée
um we will be having a holiday week soon in the philippines
so i'm looking forward to travel um first week of april
um that's correct
hm yes
i'm looking forward to leave manila um on thursday and so it most likely be thurs~ the same day
and um i'm thinking of staying at least a day or two
um yah
so yah that's another good question
um i'm actually into sporting activities
but i don't mind going to places in singapore that are um already popular to a lot of tourists that go there
so um i'd like to hear first what you have to say um about the destinations most people would like to go to
um and then i probably consider it um or not if i think that it doesn't fit my preferences then i'd let you know uh if i can also visit some other activities like a basketball game uh if there is something that will be done or happening on that same day that i'll go there
that is correct
yes
okay
so this is- this should be the primary destination right
for most tourists
i'm sorry
could you say that again
alright
right
yah i do
okay
right
right
these are all interesting spots however um i've heard of sentosa before um and i've heard from my friends who've actually been to singapore and have been to sentosa that it's a relatively expensive place to be and the budget that i'd like to allocate for this trip would about uh a thousand singaporean dollars
oh!
oh interesting
hm so what are the top uh attractions in sentosa
hm so what are the top uh attractions in sentosa
oh! um sure
oh! um sure
so it there a hotel nearby
so it there a hotel nearby
right
the- wow
okay
so um yah you mentioned that i have to stay in chinatown get a hotel in there before i go to sentosa
so is that something that i have to do by foot or do i actually have to reserve a vehicle for transportation
yah that's a good option for me
yah that's a good option for me
uh hm okay
um yes it's gonna be overnight
so just a few clothes shirts and pants
interesting
yes
i can see it
okay
um there are lots of signs um that i can actually use as reference if i need to get off somewhere
will i u~ actually use a bo- mobile phone to contact someone
okay good
the line that connects to the- to- from the green to the- to chinatown is that another transportation or is that something i have to go by foot
okay
uh do they speak as good as you
right
okay
'cause uh are you familiar with the reality show um amazing race
alright
the game
yah they did
but um uh you know um i'm not very good when it comes to location or direction
so uh i'm not gonn~ i'm probably not gonna be a good fit for that game
that's what i'm saying
that's what i'm saying
you need give me really good directions here
otherwise i get lost
yes
okay
yes
okay
about the map that you mentioned is that something that i have to pay for or is it part of the trip
okay um so we now have options
um can you tell me more about the hotels that i have lined up for me
uh you mentioned little india farrer park-
the cheap ones at least so i can enjoy the rest of my allocated budget
hm um i would prefer chinese 'cause um i'm part chinese too
but i like uh the environment when people still have uh still can get aloud even if you know late in the evening
you know um 'cause that's how we are me and my fiancée we usually go out late at night just to um grab a couple of drinks and uh just dance to the music and stuff like that
you know um 'cause that's how we are me and my fiancée we usually go out late at night just to um grab a couple of drinks and uh just dance to the music and stuff like that
okay
so there is one good one here
oh!
yah i can
wow
since you mentioned it's 1929 uh aren't there any apparitions in there
like ghosts or something
'cause that's one thing i would definitely like to try
a haunted place yah
a haunted place yah
i just wanna to try it out
it's a strange thing
okay
keong saik
yah sure of course
yah sure of course
so you've been in this hotel obviously right
from the outside of view um actually um gotten feedback from people who actually go inside
um hm yah
that would be very helpful
um one more thing is um this area you mentioned that keong saik and um nineteen twenty-nine is on the or are- they are on the same street right
so um is this part of chinatown's safe
okay
yes i can
hm okay
yah um it will be nice if i could experience that there
but i don't mind i don't mind if it doesn't
so um i'm considering either this one or nineteen twenty-nine
um based on your stay in nineteen twenty-nine and um the- just the look of this hotel from the outside which do you think is um aesthetically better
you know better looking
okay
um hm
when did you last stay here
you mentio~
oh okay
not bad
i'm not so sure about that
i wouldn't risk it
uh i don't wanna expose my body to the other people
right
but uh how- isn't it windy there you know
um it might actually affect the scene
yes they are nice
yes they are nice
terrace suite
but-
does that one-
um hm sorry
jeanne does that one the terrace suite also have um its own toilet and bathroom inside the room
not necessarily outside but inside
ah they did
oh!
i find the room really nice um honestly
the bathroom is outside
yah
um i think the deluxe room is better 'cause the junior suite has uh two beds
yah this one
this one is better
um hm okay
okay
alright
so i think i'm gonna pick this one
so i think i'm gonna pick this one
this is uh seems like a sensible choice
this is uh seems like a sensible choice
so this is um nineteen twenty-nine
hotel nineteen twenty-nine
and i'm going to get the deluxe suite
yap i can see it
okay
right
um so i'm expecting some activities right
okay
so it's very solemn
yes i am
yah that would be nice
um which is the closest one or probably the nicest um church in this area here
um which is the closest one or probably the nicest um church in this area here
okay
okay
so we're going to fly over there uh on thursday
um will there be any churches open uh until friday
um will there be any churches open uh until friday
okay
oh that'll be great
are they always accommodating
okay
um cathedral of good shepherd
how long has it been um up
okay
okay
but that's a sunday however
um we're only going to stay there 'til friday
yah
okay
okay
uh i hope you don't mind jeanne but uh are you also catholic
okay
you are also into singing then
yah
a lot of filipinos are very um- they are so into singing
so every opportunity they get they sing
yes it's nice
yes it's nice
okay
this is nicer
so this is saint joseph
wow i definitely would try that
so how do you feel about people would like to visit churches and then go drinking the night after
okay
oh this is also nice
very pretty
what is it called again
church of
saint peter and paul hm interesting
okay
'cause that will be nice if um after we actually look around or like uh go to church we'd also want to see um a little bit more
'cause that will be nice if um after we actually look around or like uh go to church we'd also want to see um a little bit more
so museums would be nice
ten minutes walking
by walking
okay
yes
hm i see it
right
um you mention that um this would probably be- i'm looking at the same timeline
uh we probably would go to the church in the morning we probably stay there until noon
so noon where do we have- where we could have lunch
um let me see
uh i'm actually very conservative
um i don't really like a lot of junk food but if i don't have any other choice i take any of the fast food chains
but um i don't mind trying new things
yah
hm no problem
go ahead
take your time
and what kind of food do they offer there
yes i can
is that pronounced as kofu
okay do you know what-
okay do you know what-
do you know what it means kofu
do you know what it means kofu
okay
okay
i believe you don't worry
uh yah good fortune

i love it
oh cool
there you go
uh i'm definitely gonna try chinese
uh i'm definitely gonna try chinese
chi~
vietnamese
i'm not sure if i tried that one but uh i definitely will
is it something like a maki
okay
yah
okay
right
oh you mentioned earlier that the price is uh reasonable
um i actually don't mind spending on food
if anything uh in this trip i don't mind spending on food
so uh that's something i'm definitely gonna try and consider
alright
so this place is good for um let say lunch
okay
yes
yah that's the same place right
bras basah
alright
so i see it
okay
yah the letter a
awesome
now um i think i already have my idea of places for- when we get there which hotel we're gonna go where- which church we're gonna visit have lunch and then go to the museum
um wou~ which places would be um a nice place to go to if we are looking to have um a few drinks and um a really nice place
you know with um music and a little bit of scenery
you know views
what do you call that
what do you call that
al fresco dining
this is going to be uh early evening right
is it still hot at that time
how about the music in this place
oh good
is that also another restaurant
okay
okay
this is-
yah
this is different from the sentosa lion right
yes
yah
alright
these were good ones
okay
so definitely going to the merlion part
yah
um how much do we have to pay for the transportation for the bus
yah
right
okay
what do you think-

oh yah
i think that those would be good options too
okay
so twelve dollars to buy the card and ten more dollars for additional transportation expenses
twenty dollars alright
right
okay
yah i think i'm gonna do that first
i don't wanna be hassled by uh having to go to um another place
but um yah i'll store everything i need at least the maximum amount in the stored value- uh ezlink card so i can just go around
okay
yah that will be nice
when you say package how many people are supposed to be in there
okay
great
i'm trying to organise my itinerary or uh our itinerary here
so um is it possible for me to actually pay for these in advance so that when we actually get to the hotel we would know um what we need to do next where were gonna stay at this time of the day and then uh when we can actually visit to wildlife reserve
you know is it something that's possible
yah
um hm yah
but the wildlife reserves the parks um this have to be done over the counter
hello!
hello!
okay
alright
wow

aviary
like how take part

i was of scared of that
uh but i've seen it on tv before
no
in the zoo you have a variety of animals too
wow
what is that

yah just to party like an animal
and uh the only word that i can say to you right now miss lynnette is wow
singapore is wow i really wanted to go there
i hope i can fly there in december
i wish
and if it possible if i can contact you or like look for you so that you can tour me around
uh okay
it's- okay
uh that would be don rommell opulencia
uh that would be don rommell opulencia
uh it's don rommell
uh it's don rommell
yah it's rommell
yah it's rommell
it's okay
it's r o m m e l l
no it's not
no it's not
yah well i was thinking of i will- i'm planning to propose to her there
yah
at singapore
at singapore
jewel box
okay so-
what-
what is at jewel box
most romantic place
i was kind of thinking something more of just uh the two of us
something like in the mountain or somewhere secluded
somewhere just the two of us
so you know we can speak our hearts out
is there any place like that there
okay
yah that sounds like a good idea
yah that sounds like a good idea
at the beach
yah
yah
yah i can see the images here
yah i can see that yah
yah i can see that yah
yah that's great
so okay
uh i guess i'd be going there
i'd be taking uh-
that's good
okay that sounds good
but i was actually thinking of taking her to the mall before going to you know the park
so besides that do we have any other options
i guess that's okay
so taking her to a big mall would be much more of a disadvantage for me
so a small mall would do
yah
yah
twelve midnight
okay
that sounds good
so let me see
i'm going to be planning my trip
so first i guess i would be going to the uh botanical garden
then next i would be going to the mall
then next- what was the name of the park
lab~
labrador
well actually no i was thinking more uh- i guess i think like i'm going to have to see the place first
but most probably- yah i guess
uh looking at the pictures i guess i would choose the botanical gardens
okay
wow
that looks good
what is that christmas season
okay
okay
too bad i wasn't able to go there at this past christmas
so-
uh yah
um anyway are all these locations are close to my hotel
uh actually- and i don't really mind doing the walk
so even if i do like long walks just to get to the place
that won't really be a problem
as long as it doesn't take me like thirty minutes or so
you know
nothing too far
trip
grand park orchard
and do uh we have images of that
so i'm guessing sing~
again please continue
um okay
okay
wa~ yah that looks great
so it would just take me a few minutes to get to the park
okay
yah okay
so that would be good
okay
so i'm guessing since uh you know uh since i'm a guy and all
i really don't have a clue to what could be or should be romantic
i'm guessing since you're suggesting these places
you find them yourself uh romantic
okay
well yah
that sounds good
um myself i think i'm okay
but i guess i would be giving that to my girlfriend
it never crossed my mind
sentosa
okay
that looks good
yah
i guess i would be doing that
uh right after i proposed
since it would be- i guess we could say stressful day for um- of because of all the travelling we'll be doing
so- yah i guess i could be planning that on the second day
yah
uh hm
but at traders hotel they do have spa treatment as well
okay
that's good
so what i would be- what i'll be doing is-
okay so i'm going to propose during the night
then i'm going to go to the spa just for her in case she needs some more time deciding
then what do you think would be the best next move in case you know we get to finish early
then what do you think would be the best next move in case you know we get to finish early
that- okay
so- yah we'll be doing that
alright
okay
um okay
okay
everything look so wonderful
wow
western food
okay
you know what really um- what i was thinking is like i real-
re~ i really would like her to experience singapore
so you know uh me taking her to a dinner with western food
that's not really singapore
that's what i'm thinking right now
but unless you have any other like options for me to go to with singaporean food
western food not really you know- i'm going to singapore and i'm going to be eating western food
shopping mall
any place more romantic
than a shopping mall
that's- that's okay
dempsey okay
sounds good
uh that's-
uh hm
would that be okay
i mean you know
or- twenty-five minutes
okay
that sounds-
that's- that sounds okay
since we are going to be experiencing singapore while walking rights
okay
i'm going with the singaporean food
so okay
so since i'm going to be ordering uh singaporean food
what do you think should i order first
since i really have no idea as to what singaporean food has to offer
chi~ okay
it's alright
so that's okay
if i use my hands or if i use my uh- if i use silver ware
okay
okay
okay
thank you
uh anyway i'm a fan of spicy foods
that really won't affect me
chicken rice
that sounds good
let me- let's see what that is
the chili crab does look tasty you know
ye~ wow
i'm thinking she's going to enjoy those
s~
saut~
satay okay
uh okay
wow
okay
that does look appetising
but the chili crab really you know it does- it won't cle~
yah
so-
okay
wow
so which would be further uh this one or dempsey
so which would be further uh this one or dempsey
okay
okay
at esplanade okay
so wow i'm like- i have so much options now
uh hm okay
so this is difficult
uh so since i'm unable to decide
let's say-
actually i'm thinking this is more singaporean if i do my proposal out there
yah
s~ oh okay
so that's-
yah
okay
s~ that was what i was thinking
especially if the moon is out
yah
okay
so the crab- i'm still thinking about the crab
but-
okay
so i guess i would be doing that from my hotel uh in the morning
then i'd be going to botanical garden around lunch time
i guess
that sound good
okay
okay esplanade
okay
oh okay
uh okay
that's good advice
so i'm guessing right now it's a bit uh humid there
it's okay
okay
okay
that sounds good
so i guess i have my first whole big plan
so what do you think should i be doing on my second day at singapore
so what do you think should i be doing on my second day at singapore
yah
yah
wow
yah
that looks good
yah
i do
so i'm guessing going to eth~
go ahead
okay
uh how do you spell that
uh what am i looking at right now
okay
so i'm guessing this suggestion of yours
this is going to give us the singaporean culture experience
so you know-
there uh hm that's popular right
it's pla~
okay
kampong- okay
yah uh hm kampong- okay
okay
thank you
okay i- you don't have to worry
since you know i'm taking my girlfriend along
she's going to be doing some heavy shopping
so-
shisha uh hm water pipe
what-
wow
how does it work
water pipe uh hm
by the way uh kampong glam is also near in traders hotel
okay
okay
okay
i will take that advice
so i'm going to be taking the mrt or a bus towards kampong glam
i'm going to have to remember that uh hm
but- water pipes
is that- that okay
so i've got-
okay
uh hm okay
smoking flavoured water
that sounds good
and we're supposed to be doing some kind of sport there
it's uh some kind of sport
yah
or is it-
uh shisha okay
okay
okay
okay
so i had a different idea of what it is
uh during our second day at singapore
i was hoping to get a little bit of historic background on singapore
but i'm really not into uh museums
so i was thinking something more of doing sightseeing
so uh hm
okay uh hm
wow
uh hm so-
okay
little india okay
um okay
that's good
spaceship
uh hm okay
okay
so that would be the new one
the one with a plate on top
i'm feeling-
where is that
uh parliament house
okay
so i'm going to be able to visit all the buildings because it's close-by
it's- okay
that looks big
oh okay
that sad
and- i- kind of just noticed a picture where there's a boat
uh if you'd scroll up a little bit
you know like to ride a- uh okay
that's good
uh hm okay
yah
okay
yah okay
uh hm okay
oh okay
okay uh hm so uh what would you suggest i take the boat ride during the afternoon or during the morning
okay
uh hm okay
okay
okay
okay
that sounds good
that sounds good
okay
well actually the sightseeing i will be doing much more of that
but the shopping that's what my girlfriend would be there for
she would probably shop 'til she drops
if you know what i mean
so that would be close to the hotel still
okay
okay
okay
could- okay
uh i just hope i bring enough um money for that
i'm just hoping that after all the shopping
she is going to do- she is going to remember that i proposed to her you know
she might forget that i actually proposed the day before
so~
okay
okay
uh thank you
uh that was a lot of shopping malls
just like the crab but something else
i was- i'm still thinking about the crab but that would be our highlight for our first day
yah for the food- singaporean food
but what about the second day
what do you think should i've order first
something- yah something sweet but romantic
yah and local of course
at- i guess since we're going to be walking around a lot
i guess we could have it in a restaurant
yah
no that's okay
i still remember
okay
so those are fried noodles
okay
that i would have to remember
fried hokkien mee
night safari
that sounds good
uh fried- for fried hokkien mee that would be available on almost all the restaurants we go to there
okay
okay
okay
uh this would be at around what time
uh this would be at around what time
okay
so we only have a few hours
um i'm looking at the pictures right now
it does seem like the park is quite big
yah uh
okay
uh yah i'm hoping i'm energetic enough to do those walks
wow
this looks good
so that would take me forty minutes to finish
okay
and i'm just really hoping she remembers that i am going to propose to her

we're gonna be there until eleven perhaps
alright
or ten thirty and then uh we can walk going to merlion from here
okay so picture taki~ what else can we do at the merlion park
what can we do there

that's nice
okay
so right
so we have half of the day planned
well for me i plan to shop
but um i don't think at two pm that would be a really nice um time to shop 'cause it might be too hot
um well street shopping would do i think
'cause um i've heard that's really expensive when we go to shopping malls in singapore
yah
but around two pm what do you think we do- what do you suggest for us to do
but around two pm what do you think we do- what do you suggest for us to do
oh nice
do you have a singapore museum where we can actually um uh learn about singapore
i'm not sure
um i have seen this um documentary from um national geographic
um there is a museum where you have bottles of water on the wall because um they've said that um water was very um- a very important resource way back then as it you actually import that
is that true
yes i think i'd like to see that wall with a lot of mineral uh water bottles
um but tiny
um but tiny
can you enlarge that for me
is it free to enter that barrage
okay
oh well that's fine
that's fine
um so we're going to- i think this would be a good time for us to check this out after lunch

we can go straight to shopping
we can go straight to shopping
do you- what's the shopping district called
do you- what's the shopping district called

so during the evening what do you suggest
i wanted something special this time
how much would that- would do you think would cost us to have dinner there
okay so i'm just trying to think

a hundred and seventy three so that would cost us around uh three hundred forty six and then we're gonna have three hundred
a hundred and seventy three so that would cost us around uh three hundred forty six and then we're gonna have three hundred
so that's for everything
but as i've said um i'm good with the hotel
so that's one hundred seventy three for per night
that- if i'm going to ha~ stay for two nights that would mean three hundred forty six in total
so i'm left with like less than nine- um six hundred dollars to spend for the whole day
so um a lot of places that you've mentioned um will be
yah
yap so i'm left with four hundred
four-
yah roughly four hundred dollars
yes of course
'cause of course we're still going to shop
'cause of course we're still going to shop
i'm going to shop
so perhaps shopping would be around two hundred
tips and anything
tips and anything
the price not really clear for me
is that the one below each of the meal
like this mesclun salad is fourteen dollars
ah okay
okay but this marina bay sands is really good
so what's that place
what hotel is that

yah
yah

yup
um i think the first or the second one uh the beach hotel or the park view hotel would be great

um basically the same weekend uh during the race
i think that's uh the second or third week of uh september right
um okay
yup that would be perfect
how much do i save if in case we book a little bit earlier just like re~ maybe right now if we can book them so that we can uh maybe save something um uh as compared to uh booking them right before the race weekend
