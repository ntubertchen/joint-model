is that like an all-day pass
okay ten dollars per person
okay ten dollars per person

um my family and i went to india uh maybe a few years back

it's fine alright
and that goes for all the hotels all the uh establishments in uh sentosa and also on the mainland is that right
that's good
m a y a
uh huh
g
but um i've heard so many good things about it but i don't really know anything about singapore
i'm just kidding
uh i'm um turning twenty six this year
uh huh that's right
not- i don't need the kitchen i think
i just need uh not really a big room but not a very uh how to say not a very small enough for me to walk around but not you know bump on the bed or somewhere there
alright
uh huh
yes
wi-fi will be really nice
are there pictures of the rooms in this hotel
yes i hope they do
ah yah
oh there
yes i forgot about the rates already
oh okay that's really nice
alright
i'm thinking uh the fastest uh way to get to the hotel or maybe how i can move about the city you know without much hassle
i mean traffic yah
okay
i just wanna try the simple dishes for singapore
to those yes
near my hotel oh
okay
oh
yes i like that
oh there's a difference
uh the chewy junior
oh great
oh i can shop there
uh huh
i've heard that yes there um like accessories and clothes and shoes
do you think i can buy things with three hundred dollars
what do you suggest i do
maybe performances yes
maybe performances yes
but casinos are nice
the show at night
just outside the hotel
well the hotel sounds like it's very nice
okay i'll bear that in mind
uh not the- the spelling is not y u k i but e u k e
yes it sounds unique
but- but i don't know where to go
i only have one thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket
i prefer a round trip ticket
yes it is the fourth of april
take your time
so how much if i add- how much- what if i add um two thousand singaporean dollar for my budget
so how-
however if you will tour me in singapore how many hours per day will you be with me
can i took pictures or are we allowed to take pictures
alright
for the wildlife reserves right
actually it's affordable
so in the morning we'll go to jurong bird park um in the afternoon-
nice beaches in singapore
now- yes
hello
alright
so it's one of the prohibitions in your country that we don't have to litter anywhere right
i'm throwing pieces of litter every- anywhere
uh alright
and oh by the way on the second day-
would you-
it's spanish time siloso
so- how much would it cost
yes
regard- about your country
yes
but- uh so you mean to say that to prepare it um a chef would prefer to mix it all together the rice and the chicken
do you also have- do you also have like that
i think that is romantic
oh i see
so does it include the shuttle fare
oh i see
uh uh excluding the food allowance or the air fare
yes
and then for the museum i think it won't cost much
building so it's a public architecture so it's- i think for free
will you go with us to the airport after the three-day tour
alright
and i wish to see you there
yes something around a hundred to one hundred fifty a day
i would prefer something like in the commercial district where i can walk around and uh take a look at the sceneries and you know
what are the rates for the grand park hotel
local singaporean delicacy so maybe we could some out of those dishes
chili crab
so do you like spicy food or most singaporean foods are spicy
alright
so- so it's inside the marina bay or it's beyond or it's just uh walking distance from the marina bay itself
in the daytime only
alright my kids will uh definitely love to see those animals
so maybe we can book in advance
uh maybe on the april time when we go there uh we can uh go directly on your recommended place

uh we're not going to carry much stuff
um well not too low though
what else is there any to
um i like you know i wanna see all kinds of animals that you don't get to see in the states
yap
so they have a bar there
alright so- it doesn't sa~
that- isn't that for ninety dollars per night
oh looks like cute
wow
yah
so they pretty much made it uh a tourist spot or upscale place
so uh if it is in- if it is in uh area of chinatown i got- do i have to communicate
they will bring a translator or something to speak to them
that's an interesting term
oh wait i heard- i heard- i heard someone say that before
so-
oh are we allowed to like go near the birds and feed them in some way
wha~
oh no that won't make- that we might bring in something that they shouldn't be eating
okay so thirty-two singapore dollars for each person
okay so that's the system
no no i won't
so i go for that
yes
the best places to shop
wow
so i mean since i've a lot of money and lots of gifts to buy
um hm okay
last time i went to bangkok
yap
like uh little key chains
like uh do- does uh singapore offer like a variety of uh tea and herbs
oh it's like-
oh so it's like they have like little stalls set up with the umbrellas and that's where they uh placed their merchandise
so that's supposed to be um near the hotel
um because uh earlier i mentioned that uh we want to check out beaches if there are any
so uh can you recommend like uh place or if there is water park
so uh can you recommend like uh place or if there is water park
um yah just swimming
wait uh do you know how many meters or how far and of a walking distance
i can't really take taxis or walk i mean too much or-
so-
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
oh it's- oh so if you blink too fast you will miss it
yes please
so is that separate from the uh the singapore zoo that we saw earlier
that's a good way to put it
no none so- none no more questions
thank you ms jeanne
so um i'd like to hear first what you have to say um about the destinations most people would like to go to
yah
okay
but have you seen uh how they actually go about the competition
okay
okay
a picture would be nice
right
pretty good huh
yap i can see it
so this is double right
and this is uh for the entire year right
that's fine
interesting
so um that seems like a very good um time to go to church
alright
so do they have a museum or some sort
seems like a big place
yes
okay
a really nice place for lunch
so-
it's in the same area right
kofu
okay
alright
oh good
okay
but um i've tried a few indian food as well but um what's the other
um okay
um i'm assuming this would probably end at around six or seven in the evening
okay
okay
um is it up-to-date with you know the current hits
what do you think is a reasonable amount i need to put in the ez uh card-
when you say package how many people are supposed to be in there
okay
you still there
yah
um by the way um since you're showing me all of this it reminds me of something
hm if it is safe enough to actually eat in their presence or do they try to steal your food
you're probably right
that's right
okay good
interesting
yap that still within um our funds
yah hundred sixteen dollars for both of us uh for this trip
i'm not really worried
so can you help me with this tour
but that's cool to know
okay
you just told me about the sari what kind of cloth is that
i mean is that for the head i mean for the whole body
it's okay don't worry
yes i see that one now
so it's just wrapping
oh i see
so meaning to say they are just gonna light their houses with candle and scented candles right
okay
so is it- orchard road is like the main city of singapore
what are the other events which is happening in december rather than in orchard road
no way
wow
wow
what would be the-
differences like- differences like amenities
so you mean this particular place were visited by popular people or famous people like from the hollywood
that's great so- meaning-
more on musical
but how about the accommodation how much would it cost me
uh it's okay
age
why
so we have that ku de ta did i say that right
yes
yah
wow walking exercise that's fun
yes
bye
hi this is participant number thirty-two
it's r o m m e l l
it's going to be a gift to my girlfriend
so there aren't really other people
just the two of us
well-
so it's secluded
i guess you can't really find a place that is that secluded anymore
uh okay
okay
since you know i'm going to get to see the place a lot more
okay
good you- good that you suggested it
and okay
i'm really having a hard time choosing
so it- i think uh if the traders uh hotel has singapore food there
then i guess i would be taking here there instead
but- but from orchard road if we decide to like walk the distance towards dempsey
so why is that
that's okay
wow
i can't get the chili crab off my mind
yah
right
the reflection-
because here it's actually raining
okay
okay
that would be a pipes with water in them
yah uh at uh water pipe
oh okay
i'm guessing- i'm thinking this place is alive during the evening towards night time
the one with the dome on top
okay
yah
are we able to do that there
okay
uh hm okay
i do
okay
okay
okay
okay
i'm hoping that all these places are uh- i guess i should call it close to your heart
it's actually the reason i chose to go to singapore
s~
okay
thank you
hi jeanne my name is june
now my concern is how far would that be from the airport
so um shall there'll be um a person or a ride that could pick us up uh from the hotel- uh from the airport going to the hotel
okay
okay
um where is the city centre
um could you show me how much that would be
so how is your day going so far jeanne
um well actually we're spending um an asian tour
yes
ah okay seven o'clock
yes
yes
um o~ is it safe there
like um- where in you have a very small room
so it's indicated there that there is internet services
i just go to that website
well i've seen that um next to chinatown will be clarke quay
i wanna be in the middle of the city
so i'm just thinking that if i'm gonna get that hotel
okay
no i just thought that it looks like a durian
and then uh we're gonna spend at the esplanade around- so that's nine fifteen
okay
that looks delightful
um right after lunch that would be around two pm what would be a good thing to do
hm what's the significance of number nine
hm what's the significance of number nine
how much would that- would do you think would cost us to have dinner there
so that would mean we're only left with less than four hundred dollars to spend
yah but of course we still have to take um transportation and all this stuff
so what's that place
oh so we're on that place
so are- is that restaurant that one at the top
wow it would be amusing to have dinner at that place
bye
um i don't have any idea about singapore and how to go uh with some places there
okay
yes uh because he's my co-worker and i'm planning to go to beach
yes

okay
okay
okay

but the only problem is we have to share the comfort rooms
quite big

uh huh
so um is the coffee shop some of sort of a restaurant or is it like a kiosk
but um i need to make sure um mathew if they're gonna allow three ladies occupy one room
oh okay
so a cheaper hotel than this wouldn't look really presentable right
where is this at
it's where the cheapest stuff are right
'cause i'm a really cheap lady you see
um as to how- what- how cheap is the transpo
alright
uh huh
okay

'cause-
it's just one trip anyway right
so there is cab right
i agree

lucky plaza first and then we go here to get drunk right
lucky plaza first and then we go here to get drunk right
