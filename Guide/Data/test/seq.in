barcelon ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** alright ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yes ***next*** and you were saying that you wanted to come to singapore ***next*** uh maybe can i have a little bit more details like uh when will you be coming ***next*** 
yes ***next*** and you were saying that you wanted to come to singapore ***next*** uh maybe can i have a little bit more details like uh when will you be coming ***next*** and like who will you be coming with ***next*** 
uh yes ***next*** um i'm actually planning to visit ***next*** uh on august ***next*** alright ***next*** 
uh i'm uh ***next*** we're planning to go to singapore on his birthday ***next*** that's actually his birthday august twenty sixth ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and how many days will you be uh spending in singapore ***next*** uh actually it would be just for a one day stopover ***next*** okay ***next*** 
uh yes it is ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** and has any of your friends or relatives came to singapore before ***next*** 
uh yes i've had a couple of uh friends or officemates who actually you know who've been to singapore before ***next*** but i haven't gotten really much um information from them ***next*** okay you will be arriving at singapore ***next*** on the twenty fifth i guess ***next*** 
correct ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** okay so uh what are your son like ***next*** 
um i think any ***next*** uh we really want to try out like maybe the signature um dishes in singapore ***next*** like you know it's like if you've been to singapore you have to really taste this or eat this ***next*** alright ***next*** 
alright ***next*** okay ***next*** like ***next*** like chili crabs ***next*** 
if ***next*** is that the signature dish of singapore ***next*** okay ***next*** uh yes ***next*** 
um and of course uh pepper crabs as well ***next*** okay ***next*** uh so i think we ***next*** the locals here generally if we have friends coming over ***next*** 
um i actually want to try out ***next*** because uh i've watched in the television like asian food network over here that there are a lot of um ***next*** i think they call it the hawker um ***next*** yes ***next*** 
you know where we should go to you know have a try on that place ***next*** right ***next*** okay ***next*** and ***next*** 
and ***next*** alright maybe i can do a recommendation now ***next*** okay ***next*** um okay if like if you arrived in the airport ***next*** 
alright maybe i can do a recommendation now ***next*** okay ***next*** um okay if like if you arrived in the airport ***next*** we have three terminals at the moment ***next*** 
okay ***next*** that's located on the eastern part of singapore ***next*** and you will be checking in to the hotel ***next*** let's say if you are putting up in the orchard road hotel ***next*** 
that's located on the eastern part of singapore ***next*** and you will be checking in to the hotel ***next*** let's say if you are putting up in the orchard road hotel ***next*** uh that is like about thirty minutes' drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels ***next*** 
uh that is like about thirty minutes' drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels ***next*** okay ***next*** so there are quite a number of hotels there ***next*** so again it depends on your budget ***next*** 
and that's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there ***next*** as well as the uh buses and it is also the main shopping belt ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** can i ***next*** all items ***next*** 
um i'm sorry ***next*** go ahead ***next*** uh i was ***next*** okay ***next*** 
and uh ***next*** mrt ***next*** okay ***next*** correct ***next*** 
correct ***next*** so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport you can go to the subway train station ***next*** you just look for direction ***next*** it's pretty clear ***next*** 
it's pretty clear ***next*** uh you look for the direction that says uh city train ***next*** and you go down uh to the train station and you can buy uh a tourist card ***next*** or ***next*** 
um may i have a ***next*** do you have an idea lynnette like how much does it cost in that hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** uh it's about in the region of singapore dollars ***next*** 
do you have an idea lynnette like how much does it cost in that hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** uh it's about in the region of singapore dollars ***next*** uh three hundred dollars per room ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** um because here's the thing ***next*** um i only actually have one thousand ***next*** alright ***next*** 
but if it would be me my husband and my son that would be considered as a package tour right ***next*** uh not necessary ***next*** okay ***next*** you can actually just come in take the subway to the hotel ***next*** 
uh not necessary ***next*** okay ***next*** you can actually just come in take the subway to the hotel ***next*** and uh you can do a one way tour ***next*** 
so let's say it's uh the three of us and then i only have one thousand dollars ***next*** so let's um so if we do with the hotel which cost you said three hundred dollars right ***next*** yes ***next*** right ***next*** 
because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about ***next*** again depending on the timing that you have arrive ***next*** uh in the region of let's say forty dollars ***next*** singapore dollars ***next*** 
okay and how much does the standard card um cost ***next*** okay and how much does the standard card um cost ***next*** okay ***next*** it depends on which uh particular location that you are going to ***next*** 
so let's say if the taxi ***next*** the mrt cost one dollar for example then you will have to put two dollars into the machine ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so i will suggest that when you are ***next*** let's say your husband is trying to get ***next*** 
so i will suggest that when you are ***next*** let's say your husband is trying to get ***next*** uh retrieve the bags uh at the conveyor belt ***next*** at the belts ***next*** 
uh there are also money changer inside uh the airport area ***next*** okay ***next*** so maybe one can take care of the bags ***next*** uh the other person will go and change some money first ***next*** 
just uh change a little bit of money just for your meals ***next*** in the hotel uh in the hawker centres ***next*** alright ***next*** as well as for the ride to the hotel ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh or anything more but i think this is just for my recommendation ***next*** just some money to get by for the short while ***next*** you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier ***next*** 
thank you ***next*** yah ***next*** and if you are spending let's say money in the uh shopping centre ***next*** uh or buying tickets to universal studio you can always pay them with credit cards ***next*** 
and if you are spending let's say money in the uh shopping centre ***next*** uh or buying tickets to universal studio you can always pay them with credit cards ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
so i think the most uh advisable time for us to arrive is really in the morning right ***next*** so that we could have all afternoon and stay there up until um the night ***next*** is that a good time ***next*** yes ***next*** 
is that a good time ***next*** yes ***next*** right ***next*** so i mean if you are going to ***next*** 
yes ***next*** right ***next*** so i mean if you are going to ***next*** because it's a short flight from philippines so you can arrive in the morning on saturday uh ***next*** 
right ***next*** so i mean if you are going to ***next*** because it's a short flight from philippines so you can arrive in the morning on saturday uh ***next*** on the twenty sixth uh and then you stay overnight the next day ***next*** 
uh so from the hotel okay so um you mentioned that it's only thirty minutes uh from the hotel to get to ***next*** i mean from the airport to get to the hotel is that correct ***next*** okay from ***next*** if you're taking the subway ***next*** 
oh ***next*** okay ***next*** forty five minutes that's fine ***next*** yah ***next*** 
forty five minutes that's fine ***next*** yah ***next*** alright ***next*** it's pretty frequent ***next*** 
would you consider this uh as more of a like a child friendly or a family uh friendly type of a hotel ***next*** you know given that i have a kid with me ***next*** um okay ***next*** this is just a normal kind of a hotel ***next*** 
um okay ***next*** this is just a normal kind of a hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** uh so they do have uh quite a lot of family staying in this hotel as well ***next*** 
so um from there we can already like maybe go to universal studios ***next*** is that near this hotel ***next*** uh yah it's pretty convenient ***next*** because again you can take the subway ***next*** 
so what you do is ***next*** okay let's say we skip the arrival part right ***next*** i mean that's done right ***next*** you are quite uh you know what's going on from your airport you take the subway ***next*** 
so what you can do is you just go across the road ***next*** there are small cafes just across your road ***next*** the road ***next*** and uh there is quite a famous i would say uh roti prata store ***next*** 
but it's an indian pancake ***next*** oh cool ***next*** yah ***next*** and uh ***next*** 
it has all kind of fillings in there; chicken ***next*** uh beef uh even sardine ***next*** alright ***next*** and ***next*** 
and you can eat it with your hands just like the locals ***next*** okay ***next*** right ***next*** it's a piece of pancake ***next*** 
okay ***next*** right ***next*** it's a piece of pancake ***next*** you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry ***next*** 
it's a piece of pancake ***next*** you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry ***next*** oh cool ***next*** but of course if you don't want you can always use the spo~ and ***next*** 
you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry ***next*** oh cool ***next*** but of course if you don't want you can always use the spo~ and ***next*** oh fork and spoon ***next*** 
okay ***next*** alright ***next*** so you can have that for breakfast it's quite a filling dish ***next*** so maybe i'll suggest that uh a one piece it depends on what kind of meat you order ***next*** 
so that is ***next*** this is something very local as well ***next*** alright ***next*** yes so you can have that ***next*** 
uh majority of us here speaks english ***next*** uh because english is our first language and all our sign are all in english ***next*** okay good ***next*** yes ***next*** 
uh because english is our first language and all our sign are all in english ***next*** okay good ***next*** yes ***next*** so if there's any uh problem you need directions please feel free to approach anybody that looks like a local ***next*** 
great ***next*** yah so it's not a real issue ***next*** uh okay the mrt again uh i would suggest that uh you take a map of the mrt ***next*** so that you have a better idea how to travel ***next*** 
north east ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so i think the detailed part i think we should ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so i think the detailed part i think we should ***next*** you should be able to work it out right ***next*** 
uh i just would have to identify on which uh station is that what you call it ***next*** on which station i ***next*** we should be um going ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yes ***next*** and then ***next*** uh okay no ***next*** 
we have a map ***next*** oh ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** 
oh ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** let me try and get you the uh mrt map ***next*** 
okay ***next*** let me try and get you the uh mrt map ***next*** so there are a few lines ***next*** okay from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong ***next*** 
let me try and get you the uh mrt map ***next*** so there are a few lines ***next*** okay from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong ***next*** then we have the north to the south line ***next*** 
so there are a few lines ***next*** okay from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong ***next*** then we have the north to the south line ***next*** and we have another line the north east line ***next*** 
okay from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong ***next*** then we have the north to the south line ***next*** and we have another line the north east line ***next*** uh and a circle line ***next*** 
uh and a circle line ***next*** right now these are uh the lines that's available ***next*** okay ***next*** so once you get down to the mrt uh you will be able to see uh the map ***next*** 
um uh i'm not able to see it on my um screen yet ***next*** okay ***next*** um i think uh you have to share that with me for me to able to see it on my screen over here ***next*** alright ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yah nothing ***next*** okay ***next*** the ***next*** 
yah nothing ***next*** okay ***next*** the ***next*** alright okay ***next*** 
the ***next*** alright okay ***next*** the changi side is on the east ***next*** it's on the green line ***next*** 
it's starting to download ***next*** uh alright ***next*** yes i can see it now ***next*** alright ***next*** 
uh alright ***next*** yes i can see it now ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes ***next*** alright ***next*** so that is actually the east west line ***next*** so can you follow towards your lefthand side ***next*** 
where is that ***next*** just go to the left ***next*** so from changi ***next*** okay ***next*** 
just go to the left ***next*** so from changi ***next*** okay ***next*** changi you will see expo ***next*** 
okay ***next*** changi you will see expo ***next*** expo right ***next*** yes ***next***

and like i said ***next*** again breakfast time no issue ***next*** uh just outside your hotel there are lots of eating places ***next*** and you can get a breakfast for uh ***next*** 
where is universal studios here ***next*** alright ***next*** is it also along with the green lines ***next*** okay then so ***next***

purple line ***next*** is that also in the red one or the ***next*** oh the purple line ***next*** yah ***next*** 
correct ***next*** and uh harbour ***next*** yah harbourfront ***next*** harbourfront ***next*** 
so you will alight at harbourfront ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so i think i will not confuse you with telling you all the cost of the mrt ride ***next*** 
which station you are going to ***next*** press harbourfront ***next*** okay ***next*** and the machine will tell you how much to pay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and the machine will tell you how much to pay ***next*** alright ***next*** so when you are taking the subway please remember to take a small singapore money with you ***next*** 
yah ***next*** um do we have to pay for that as well ***next*** yes ***next*** the cable car ride uh i will suggest that you take like uh one way ***next*** 
um do we have to pay for that as well ***next*** yes ***next*** the cable car ride uh i will suggest that you take like uh one way ***next*** uh it's about twelve dollars ***next*** 
okay ***next*** why ***next*** oh okay ***next*** because if you have time you can go swimming in our beautiful lagoon on sentosa ***next*** 
yah ***next*** and on sen ***next*** yah i would like that ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah i would like that ***next*** yah ***next*** on sentosa itself you can go on the uh ***next*** okay i'll close this uh mrt uh map ***next*** 
and then i will show you the sentosa map ***next*** okay ***next*** you can get by using the buses on sentosa ***next*** uh and the buses that operates on sentosa were ***next*** 
so sentosa is actually um ***next*** because i'm seeing your screen right now ***next*** so it's actually an island ***next*** yes it's an island just about one kilometre away from the mainland ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay and you see uh tall tower and then there's something down that has a little bit of u ***next*** right ***next*** okay can you see my arrow ***next*** 
this arrow ***next*** okay so you can take the cable car alright across ***next*** okay that is optional ***next*** so let's see how you ***next*** 
okay that is optional ***next*** so let's see how you ***next*** we you know oh after you ***next*** i think yah that's a nice ride here ***next*** 
sentosa buses ***next*** okay ***next*** okay and they are colour coded as well ***next*** but uh again you just look at where you are going to ***next*** 
can you see resort world ***next*** oh ***next*** yes ***next*** yah ***next*** 
so it's actually over this side ***next*** nice alright ***next*** okay and of course it's like a theme park ***next*** so you can see uh you know you can basically spend like three quarter of a day or almost a day ***next*** 
so we can buy it online as well ***next*** yes ***next*** and do you have an idea how much would the ticket cost ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes ***next*** and do you have an idea how much would the ticket cost ***next*** okay ***next*** uh a day pass for the adult will cost singapore dollars sixty six dollars ***next*** 
yah ***next*** and forty eight ***next*** but um ***next*** okay ***next*** 
but um ***next*** okay ***next*** but just to check again let me see ***next*** the date twenty sixth august is that a weekday or weekend ***next*** 
yah there's a difference in the price when ***next*** if it's a weekday or a weekend ***next*** yes correct ***next*** so like at weekend it will be at seventy two dollars for the adult and a child will be fifty two dollars ***next*** 
right ***next*** yah ***next*** correct ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes ***next*** so that is a nice uh ride to do ***next*** uh and of course there are other shows and ***next*** i think i will suggest that lunch you just have a meal in universal studio itself ***next*** 
because you know it takes time to come out and then go in again ***next*** so i'll just ***next*** i will suggest that lunch you have it in universal studio ***next*** so they have like fast food available ***next*** 
so i'll just ***next*** i will suggest that lunch you have it in universal studio ***next*** so they have like fast food available ***next*** uh to local food as well ***next*** 
uh to local food as well ***next*** uh so maybe just a quick lunch like a sandwich or something ***next*** okay ***next*** and then carry on ***next*** 
and then carry on ***next*** depending on how much uh your son would like to stay in there ***next*** okay ***next*** how much time he wants to spend there right ***next*** 
how much time he wants to spend there right ***next*** yes ***next*** okay ***next*** so because the uh universal studio opening hours it's from ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay ***next*** so because the uh universal studio opening hours it's from ***next*** ten am to seven pm ***next*** 
yah ***next*** that's right ***next*** so you could spend like let's say from ten o'clock you know if you go early in the morning for your swim ***next*** or even if you don't want to swim just take a walk in the bea ***next*** 
uh in ***next*** around the beach area ***next*** and then you just take a sentosa bus to the universal studio or you can also take the uh ***next*** what do you call that ***next*** 
what do you call that ***next*** the train on sentosa itself ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
the train on sentosa itself ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** uh those are all included so you don't have to pay extra money ***next*** 
or even six ***next*** and then you go for your dinner with the chili crabs ***next*** yah great ***next*** alright ***next*** 
before we leave so we have to shop ***next*** so um i know that singapore is very popular when it comes to gadgets ***next*** right ***next*** yes ***next*** 
so maybe if you ***next*** before you come you know you can always check on the prices first ***next*** okay ***next*** and uh because there are so many shops out there that sells similar items so they are pretty ***next*** 
so it's like a one uh stop shop for like different gadgets ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** 
so there's also competition going on between um the sellers there ***next*** yes so what you ***next*** maybe they may not be able to give you like a lot of discount ***next*** uh but they can always give you freebies ***next*** 
maybe they may not be able to give you like a lot of discount ***next*** uh but they can always give you freebies ***next*** because they know that if you go into the shop and you walked out ***next*** you'll probably end up buying from someone else ***next*** 
alright ***next*** okay ***next*** so it's quite reputable the shops there ***next*** so i will recommend like this location ***next*** 
so it's quite reputable the shops there ***next*** so i will recommend like this location ***next*** so you can do your shopping out there ***next*** and let's say your ***next*** 
so i will recommend like this location ***next*** so you can do your shopping out there ***next*** and let's say your ***next*** you can leave your husband there for yourself ***next*** 
oh that's nice ***next*** so we can actually separate from each other and i can do my own shopping ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** 
uh in the raffles place ***next*** uh sorry raffles city ***next*** because it's just above the city hall mrt ***next*** uh they have from the branded ***next***

so they have all ***next*** yes they have all your shoes your clothes ***next*** the ladies the gents ***next*** toiletries cosmetics everything is in there ***next*** 
um is it like um somewhat similar to um hong kong or you could say that it's actually much cheaper ***next*** it's different because the quality here uh is better i would say ***next*** it's not like the street kind of uh shopping ***next*** they are shops ***next*** 
they are shops ***next*** so the quality is good i would say ***next*** so it all depends ***next*** let's say if you are buying the branded product i think here in singapore we are still relatively affordable ***next*** 
let's say if you are buying the branded product i think here in singapore we are still relatively affordable ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** uh and uh if you are buying the midrange products ***next*** 
uh they are in uh i would say a good condition ***next*** okay ***next*** great ***next*** alright ***next*** 
and it's so easy you know ***next*** you ***next*** once you arrived back in the airport when you are leaving singapore ***next*** you just produce the receipt that has been stamped ***next*** 
you ***next*** once you arrived back in the airport when you are leaving singapore ***next*** you just produce the receipt that has been stamped ***next*** uh sorry ***next***

yes ***next*** so if you don't want to get out of this place you can also do your shopping out here ***next*** okay ***next*** uh and uh ***next*** 
uh and uh ***next*** but since your husband wants to do the tech product ***next*** so i think i would suggest that you have your dinner there ***next*** and then proceed to uh funan centre ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so ***next*** yah because the shops will open like uh ten thirty in the morning ***next*** so you can ***next*** 
funan ***next*** do a bit ***next*** yes ***next*** so allocate let's say about one hour ***next*** 
okay ***next*** shopping time for him ***next*** and then you go on to sentosa let's say at about uh in the afternoon ***next*** one o'clock twelve o'clock ***next*** 
shopping time for him ***next*** and then you go on to sentosa let's say at about uh in the afternoon ***next*** one o'clock twelve o'clock ***next*** you'll be in sentosa ***next*** 
and then you go on to sentosa let's say at about uh in the afternoon ***next*** one o'clock twelve o'clock ***next*** you'll be in sentosa ***next*** okay you can do your lunch again if you are doing funan ***next*** 
so that's ***next*** thank you for giving me a lot of uh options ***next*** but then ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay ***next*** um so uh like within sentosa there are also places where i can ***next*** like maybe get a massage or you know something like that ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** there is a spa there as well ***next*** uh so while your kids are enjoying and your husband enjoying their time in universal ***next*** you can go for your spa ***next*** 
is that outside universal or within universal ***next*** it's outside universal ***next*** oh okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** or alternatively if your husband is doing his shopping down in funan ***next*** 
okay ***next*** or alternatively if your husband is doing his shopping down in funan ***next*** you can always get your spa done ***next*** uh at the uh nearby uh hotel area ***next*** 
and um the price range ***next*** sorry 'cause i'm you know i'm um budget conscious ***next*** and the price range uh could you give me an idea on that ***next*** yah alright ***next*** 
sorry 'cause i'm you know i'm um budget conscious ***next*** and the price range uh could you give me an idea on that ***next*** yah alright ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh i ***next*** you know if i ***next*** just the full body or just uh the legs ***next*** 
uh i ***next*** you know if i ***next*** just the full body or just uh the legs ***next*** the feet ***next*** 
yah maybe like a full body massage ***next*** like you know from like thirty minutes to an hour of that ***next*** how much would that cost ***next*** okay approximately about a hundred dollars ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah ***next*** hundred dollars ***next*** yes ***next***

uh i guess your friends the age one would be about twenty to thirty ***next*** yes ***next*** uh hm okay ***next*** and uh your budget will be in a range of a thousand dollars ***next*** 
uh but i ***next*** um individually i think our price range budget would be from thirty five to forty five thousand each ***next*** pesos so i think that would be ***next*** uh singa~ ***next*** 
the ***next*** so ***next*** okay everything that i quoted here will be in the region of a thousand dollars ***next*** so that means three person will be three thousand singapore dollars ***next*** 
a thousand uh ***next*** oh three thousand okay ***next*** alright yah ***next*** is that correct ***next***

because uh our standard card ***next*** let's say if the price is a dollar you have to put in two dollars ***next*** because there is a one dollar deposit ***next*** and when you leave the station you have to get back your deposit ***next*** 
oh i see ***next*** so there's a deposit when you ride the train okay ***next*** yah because of uh the cards ***next*** so you must remember to get back your deposit after you exit from the uh the barrier alright ***next*** 
you can buy the uh the tourist card or you can buy this stored value card as well ***next*** okay yes ***next*** hm okay ***next*** yah ***next***

depending on the year uh chinese new year usually january ***next*** where we have this major festival in chinatown ***next*** uh september would be the mooncake festival ***next*** hari raya some time in august ***next*** 
it looks like the moon ***next*** okay so this is celebrated by the chinese people ***next*** uh hm okay ***next*** it's appreciation of the moon i would say this festival ***next***

oh okay ***next*** this happen for just a whole day or it happen for a week ***next*** do you have this celebration for a week ***next*** yah we do have like in our housing estate the children can actually walk around with a lantern ***next*** 
how about ***next*** yah but ***next*** yah but anyway throughout this whole month you'll see a lot of shop selling this mooncake ***next*** a lot of shops will be selling the lanterns uh as well ***next*** 
a lot of shops will be selling the lanterns uh as well ***next*** so you get this uh mooncake uh kind of festival mood throughout the whole month ***next*** hm okay ***next*** yah ***next***

uh oh ***next*** okay you know the chinese have so many different gods ***next*** so this is just a festival that is celebrated ***next*** we have a temple in ***next*** 
okay you know the chinese have so many different gods ***next*** so this is just a festival that is celebrated ***next*** we have a temple in ***next*** somewhere in the eastern part of singapore ***next***

uh if you are going to the temples in the eastern part of singapore then yes they are ***next*** it's quite uh festive ***next*** you'll see a lot of people offering prayers ***next*** uh otherwise it is not like a nationwide kind of uh festival ***next*** 
the major festival would be like chinese new year ***next*** the chinese ***next*** deepavali hari raya and christmas eve ***next*** that's our major festival ***next*** 
that's our major festival ***next*** and ***next*** chinese new year if you are down in january feb uh january period ***next*** uh again very festivallike ***next***

can you suggest a hotel ***next*** uh an affordable hotel ***next*** affordable as in uh ***next*** what sort of price range are you talking about ***next*** 
affordable as in uh ***next*** what sort of price range are you talking about ***next*** because i'll be having a thousand singaporean dollars with me ***next*** oh that will go a long way ***next*** 
really ***next*** yes ***next*** wow so i hope you can help me find a ***next*** because uh you are ***next*** 
the ***next*** so long as i can go to the mall i mean ***next*** just walking distance so i can easily walk if i want to go to a restaurant or if i need to shop ***next*** if you are ***next*** 
just walking distance so i can easily walk if i want to go to a restaurant or if i need to shop ***next*** if you are ***next*** clothes ***next*** okay ***next*** 
small shops ***next*** small shops ***next*** that will be fine ***next*** okay i'm gonna get you hotels in chinatown ***next*** 
small shops ***next*** that will be fine ***next*** okay i'm gonna get you hotels in chinatown ***next*** okay ***next*** 
sure ***next*** just ***next*** so that's great that i can spend one thousand singapore dollars ***next*** yes you would save a lot of money shopping ***next*** 
in a week really ***next*** alright ***next*** yes ***next*** if your hotel is not too uh expensive ***next*** 
let's see huh ***next*** right ***next*** because we're planning to spend our money to you know to buy food and clothes and whatever ***next*** just ***next*** 
so ***next*** furama city centre ***next*** i can see it ***next*** affordable prices yes ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so i can see the uh i think ***next*** okay ***next*** do you see ***next*** 
keong saik hotel ***next*** this one ***next*** yes the cheapest one ***next*** okay ***next*** 
this one ***next*** yes the cheapest one ***next*** okay ***next*** i'm not saying anything ***next*** 
i'm not saying anything ***next*** i just thought that uh ***next*** so have more money shopping ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yes ***next*** alright ***next*** and then ***next*** let's say ***next*** 
alright ***next*** and then ***next*** let's say ***next*** well that's just ***next*** 
these are all um clean hotels ***next*** you know they are usually ***next*** do they have good feedback from their customers ***next*** feedback you will have to google maybe and find out ***next*** 
feedback you will have to google maybe and find out ***next*** you see it has only twenty five rooms ***next*** yah that's fine ***next*** so let me see ***next*** 
you see it has only twenty five rooms ***next*** yah that's fine ***next*** so let me see ***next*** it's a boutique hotel actually ***next*** 
i got my arrow there ***next*** right ***next*** so what they've done is they converted all shop houses into hotel rooms ***next*** so the hotel rooms are not uh very wide ***next*** 
so what they've done is they converted all shop houses into hotel rooms ***next*** so the hotel rooms are not uh very wide ***next*** perhaps uh you can get off uh your hotel room in about fifteen minutes ***next*** go and have breakfast at the little shops nearby ***next*** 
one of our latest malls ***next*** alright ***next*** and uh you overlook the singapore river if you ***next*** uh for example have a ice cream in one of the ***next*** 
we can buy more food and clothes ***next*** alright but anyway ***next*** yes ***next*** yes and you could hang out at the bars ***next*** 
uh not far ***next*** uh you can uh just walk to the nearest train station ***next*** which is tanjong pagar ***next*** and then you can take the train ***next*** 
uh really ***next*** but uh can you tell me how much will be ***next*** how much do we need to pay for the fare ***next*** oh it's very low ***next*** 
but uh can you tell me how much will be ***next*** how much do we need to pay for the fare ***next*** oh it's very low ***next*** i don't have the exact fare it goes by distance ***next*** 
how much do we need to pay for the fare ***next*** oh it's very low ***next*** i don't have the exact fare it goes by distance ***next*** but what i advise is you get a card when you come in ***next*** 
at changi airport you go to the mrt station and you collect ***next*** you pay in advance for a card with stored value ***next*** and then before you go back you'll get your change if you hand it back in ***next*** unless you want it as a souvenir ***next*** 
and then before you go back you'll get your change if you hand it back in ***next*** unless you want it as a souvenir ***next*** alright but ***next*** so you're only paying as a singaporean would pay ***next*** 
uh huh ***next*** but how much do we need to spend if we'll take the mrt all the time ***next*** um how much do we need to allot for that ***next*** if you are taking the trains and the buses ***next*** 
if you are taking the trains and the buses ***next*** transportation ***next*** i think just maybe twenty dollars or even less ***next*** it's a ***next*** 
it's for the manufacture of the card ***next*** hm i see ***next*** so let's say ***next*** so if you are not intending to bring it back you know uh it's ***next*** 
so let's say ***next*** so if you are not intending to bring it back you know uh it's ***next*** it's just the distance travelled and i think you will spend ***next*** on travel maybe only ten dollars or so ***next*** 
heading off and shopping or eating you know ***next*** alright ***next*** or probably we can allot a hundred just to be safe for the fare ***next*** oh ***next*** 
alright ***next*** or probably we can allot a hundred just to be safe for the fare ***next*** oh ***next*** no ***next*** 
and you get off say one stop from your hotel ***next*** uh you will have to pay a two dollar surcharge ***next*** uh for using the train for too long because we don't want people to hang out in the trains ***next*** that's all ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh you know where you are in chinatown ***next*** we have a very old market that has been spruced up ***next*** and it's one of my favourite places to eat ***next*** 
uh let me try and see which there ***next*** sure ***next*** and how much do i need to pay for a meal for example ***next*** if you add a lot of food ten dollars will go a long way ***next*** 
that's a lot ***next*** let's say if you bought uh different things and you tried it on ***next*** assuming you have a big appetite ***next*** uh let me see if i can get this uh ***next*** 
let's say if you bought uh different things and you tried it on ***next*** assuming you have a big appetite ***next*** uh let me see if i can get this uh ***next*** take a look ***next*** 
there are also ***next*** uh vegetarian stalls and uh fish soups if you are thinking of something healthy ***next*** uh you ***next*** do you have dietary needs ***next*** 
uh vegetarian stalls and uh fish soups if you are thinking of something healthy ***next*** uh you ***next*** do you have dietary needs ***next*** do you ***next*** 
we eat everything ***next*** my best friend is always hungry so that ***next*** we need to find the perfect restaurant ***next*** oh so that's good ***next*** 
besides going to the market there would be stalls just outside your hotel ***next*** wow that's great ***next*** uh actually i should tell you that uh your hotel is located in what uh maybe ***next*** eighty years ago was a red light district ***next*** 
wow okay that will be great ***next*** but can you suggest more activities that we can do together aside from malling and eating ***next*** uh you want to go to uh you was ***next*** you mentioned the beach earlier right ***next*** 
uh you want to go to uh you was ***next*** you mentioned the beach earlier right ***next*** right ***next*** so i'm gonna get sentosa for you ***next*** 
you mentioned the beach earlier right ***next*** right ***next*** so i'm gonna get sentosa for you ***next*** can i ***next*** 
right ***next*** so i'm gonna get sentosa for you ***next*** can i ***next*** oops just a minute ***next*** 
okay let me get back the ***next*** okay now ***next*** you see where you are you could walk to the uh mrt station ***next*** and uh you could ***next*** 
are you getting sentosa on your screen ***next*** yes i can see it now ***next*** so where you are is ***next*** let me see ***next*** 
let me get on the train ***next*** sure ***next*** uh can you see tanjong pagar ***next*** uh right at the bottom on the green line ***next*** 
okay ***next*** you go on the green line ***next*** and you go to outram park ***next*** and then you switch to the north east line ***next*** 
the purple line ***next*** you just go one stop and you're at harbourfront ***next*** right ***next*** and then you can just ask anybody for directions ***next*** 
you just go one stop and you're at harbourfront ***next*** right ***next*** and then you can just ask anybody for directions ***next*** the bus bay where sentosa operates shuttle buses into sentosa on a regular basis ***next*** 
oh i see ***next*** uh or you could take an express then you have to go ***next*** that in fact there's a huge shopping area there ***next*** there are two shopping malls there vivocity and harbourfront ***next*** 
wow perfect ***next*** but the easier way is you just go to the foot the bus bay ***next*** because at the bus bay again you can get a lot of variety of food ***next*** malay ***next*** 
right ***next*** right ***next*** uh the people who work at harbourfront at the malls they often go across the road ***next*** to where the bus terminal is to get their food ***next*** 
uh the people who work at harbourfront at the malls they often go across the road ***next*** to where the bus terminal is to get their food ***next*** so it's nice to check it out you know check it out first ***next*** and if you still want to take the express train you could ***next*** 
so it's nice to check it out you know check it out first ***next*** and if you still want to take the express train you could ***next*** you could cross the road and you make your way to vivocity and you can take the train in ***next*** otherwise you can take the shuttle ***next*** 
i would like to try the cable car ***next*** do i need to pay extra for that ***next*** yes ***next*** you need to ***next*** 
get to the top of mount faber which is near to harbourfront ***next*** and uh buy or ***next*** buy a uh sort of a package ***next*** and from the package you can get lower price entry to all the attractions ***next*** 
because the ***next*** they are packaged in such a way that you know if you like adventure ***next*** you'll see imbiah lookout ***next*** yes ***next*** 
you end up there on the island ***next*** imbiah lookout is the ***next*** is the stop ***next*** and it's on a little hill ***next*** 
from there you can walk to the butterfly park ***next*** uh you could uh take a little ride you know on this little ***next*** like sling down the little hill but this is a concrete trail ***next*** and they have a short cable car there ***next*** 
you could walk to the beach from there too ***next*** alright ***next*** so ***next*** and there's a museum in what used to be ***next*** 
so we love to see that as well ***next*** and ***next*** now on beaches you'll see what you see now ***next*** do you see the dolphins ***next*** 
can you give me an estimate so that i will know how to budget my money ***next*** maybe i say about fifty dollars or hundred dollars ***next*** hm each alright ***next*** uh let me see ***next*** 
maybe i say about fifty dollars or hundred dollars ***next*** hm each alright ***next*** uh let me see ***next*** can i get universal studios for you to get it more accurately/ ***next*** 
can i get universal studios for you to get it more accurately/ ***next*** so ***next*** sure ***next*** because there are rides that you can take there ***next*** 
because we want to go around the city and make the most of it ***next*** but two days is a little short ***next*** i think you need uh five days ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yes ***next*** probably next time ***next*** okay ***next*** 
alright ***next*** no i mean the hotel there would be you know more than a hundred dollars ***next*** alright ***next*** so we have these rides ***next*** 
not really ***next*** yah ***next*** so if you went and took these rides then it would cost more ***next*** but ***next*** 
alright ***next*** so but we're planning to spend the rest of the day in that place in sentosa ***next*** however um how far is marina bay from sentosa ***next*** uh it's a different area altogether ***next*** 
that's good ***next*** so you would be at harbourfront when you're on sentosa ***next*** so you connect with the blue line ***next*** you could either continue to dhoby ghaut and then switch to the red line ***next*** 
at marina bay aside from we can swim as well and um drink ***next*** what else can we do there ***next*** anything that is um fun or exciting ***next*** uh do you like concerts ***next*** 
sure ***next*** that will be great ***next*** i don't have the date with me but uh we can check out that ***next*** esplanade do you see esplanade ***next*** 
uh huh ***next*** it may not coincide with the time you are coming but let me see ***next*** april sixteenth ***next*** yah ***next*** 
april sixteenth ***next*** yah ***next*** okay let me see ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay let me see ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** yes okay ***next*** 
oh too bad ***next*** yah ***next*** uh they are built like the old style microphones that have the um the rounded tops ***next*** so it's like two big caps uh on the water let me see ***next*** 
it's wonderful ***next*** it's nice to just go there and take photos ***next*** and there are lot of shops in there too ***next*** um the shops would be not like your chinatown type ***next*** 
they would be ***next*** uh huh ***next*** uh huh ***next*** uh good quality shops uh ***next*** 
i don't have the calendar right now ***next*** april sixteenth ***next*** april sixteenth ***next*** april sixteen ***next*** 
i was looking at twenty one ***next*** sixteen monday ***next*** yah ***next*** no that is a ***next*** 
sixteen monday ***next*** yah ***next*** no that is a ***next*** i'm not sure what they have uh on those dates right now ***next*** 
no that is a ***next*** i'm not sure what they have uh on those dates right now ***next*** uh okay ***next*** just a minute ***next*** 
it is more full of activities ***next*** and when we are celebrating certain festivals like ***next*** chinese new year or the christmas there are lots of free performances ***next*** just in the concourse area ***next*** 
really ***next*** what about next month ***next*** don't you have any ***next*** uh let me see uh ***next*** 
grounds all events ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** march ***next*** 
december ***next*** uh singaporeans also travel so ***next*** uh rather move around singapore's attractions ***next*** so we just had the school holidays over ***next*** 
attractions ***next*** uh april i think they've all gone back to school ***next*** so uh it would not be so crowded ***next*** it would be quite relaxed ***next*** 
i will just go there on the sixteenth ***next*** no need to reschedule ***next*** okay ***next*** uh are you getting the schedule now for april ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh are you getting the schedule now for april ***next*** uh i'm afraid the background is black so ***next*** sixteenth ***next***

sixteenth ***next*** oh sorry ***next*** okay ***next*** we got a music concerto ***next*** 
okay ***next*** we got a music concerto ***next*** what uh ***next*** oh this is interesting ***next*** 
right ***next*** so that will be on the sixteenth ***next*** yes it's a twelve to ***next*** oh no twelve to ***next*** 
they take a break on monday ***next*** alright so maybe we'll try the next day ***next*** yah unless you're into dance and dance workshops on the seventeenth ***next*** that's what we have ***next*** 
are we allowed to just stay at ***next*** stay out uh around one am or two am or that's fine if we just stay until ***next*** the next day ***next*** you can stay as long as you like ***next*** 
but i don't think uh sentosa would like you to sleep on the beach ***next*** that's all ***next*** right so ***next*** so when we have a beach party they tell people that you know ***next*** 
alright ***next*** um but you know being sentosa the prices will not be the same as um let's say chinatown ***next*** uh huh ***next*** uh hm let me see ***next*** 
okay ***next*** see ***next*** wow it's a nice place ***next*** so this is a bit more ***next*** 
snorkelling ***next*** can we do that do you have extra activities ***next*** can we do that do you have extra activities ***next*** you could but frankly uh you would have to take a trip to the island ***next*** 
can we do that do you have extra activities ***next*** can we do that do you have extra activities ***next*** you could but frankly uh you would have to take a trip to the island ***next*** uh one of our outer islands to do snorkelling uh ***next*** 
i mean it's merely for swimming ***next*** uh because that's what we want to do ***next*** so can you suggest a place where we can go snorkelling ***next*** uh snorkelling ***next*** 
let me see uh ***next*** you would need to go with uh somebody who organises it i would suggest ***next*** uh huh ***next*** and i also think you should stay longer because otherwise ***next*** 
you would need to go with uh somebody who organises it i would suggest ***next*** uh huh ***next*** and i also think you should stay longer because otherwise ***next*** it's one whole day ***next*** 
and then we can just shop the next day ***next*** because our flight is at night ***next*** so we can maximise our time ***next*** uh no i'm afraid the organisers in singapore organise for outside singapore ***next*** 
there is one place uh ***next*** at sisters island but the waters there are quite rough ***next*** oh ***next*** and i'm not sure because i don't snorkel myself uh ***next*** 
oh ***next*** and i'm not sure because i don't snorkel myself uh ***next*** or rather i ***next*** uh frankly i don't snorkel in singapore ***next*** 
uh frankly i don't snorkel in singapore ***next*** oh really ***next*** you haven't tried it ***next*** no because over there it's too rough for me huh ***next*** 
you haven't tried it ***next*** no because over there it's too rough for me huh ***next*** i don't swim ***next*** i got to snorkel in very shallow water ***next*** 
no because over there it's too rough for me huh ***next*** i don't swim ***next*** i got to snorkel in very shallow water ***next*** so i have to go to places where the fish come up to your feet you know uh in very little water ***next*** 
let me try to see if they have it somewhere else here ***next*** sure ***next*** 'cause i don't want to give you ***next*** wait sorry ***next*** 
yah ***next*** lap ***next*** you know if you are buying laptops or ***next*** you are buying something expensive then you know your thousand dollars will not uh accommodate that ***next*** 
wow ***next*** uh and i have friends who go uh surveying ***next*** they're actually doing it for nature ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yah thank you for that ***next*** you can use singapore as a base to maybe ***next*** indonesia or malaysia and try snorkelling there ***next*** if you are you know very keen on seeing ***next*** 
you need to see the fish right in your eye ***next*** uh hm ***next*** uh hm ***next*** colourful corals ah ***next*** 
are they on sale next month ***next*** will they be on sale next month ***next*** let me get into the website ***next*** usually what i advise people to do is to ***next*** 
will they be on sale next month ***next*** let me get into the website ***next*** usually what i advise people to do is to ***next*** okay you have a picture of the mall there ***next*** 
so i think we should go there as well ***next*** and how far is that from our hotel ***next*** how long would it take for us to reach that area ***next*** hm you said you are good at walking right ***next*** 
right ***next*** you could walk there ***next*** oh ***next*** or you could take ***next*** 
oh ***next*** or you could take ***next*** would that take us for an hour or ***next*** no i think maybe forty minutes or thirty minutes ***next*** 
those are the peak hours ***next*** and in the evenings ***next*** but because we have the buses running also full steam and the trains they agreed ***next*** if you miss the train this morning it was two minutes before the next train came ***next*** 
hm i see ***next*** so i think it's really ***next*** it's also more fun for you you know ***next*** you'll get to see the local people ***next*** 
so i think it's really ***next*** it's also more fun for you you know ***next*** you'll get to see the local people ***next*** how we move around ***next*** 
it's also more fun for you you know ***next*** you'll get to see the local people ***next*** how we move around ***next*** um and where you are ***next*** 
you'll get to see the local people ***next*** how we move around ***next*** um and where you are ***next*** like you ***next*** 
yes uh it's as safe in both ***next*** you just don't take all your bling and hang it all around you ***next*** uh i don't think you'll be doing that right ***next*** uh just take the usual precautions ***next*** 
uh just take the usual precautions ***next*** alright ***next*** right ***next*** that uh ***next*** 
cheap souvenirs ***next*** oh ***next*** chinatown would be the best place ***next*** uh there are street stalls and there are also shops ***next*** 
but usually in chinatown they are more or less the same price for the cheap souvenirs like ***next*** three items for ten dollars ***next*** hm not bad i think ***next*** and there would be different sort of items ***next*** 
um i'm very sorry i can't uh give you better news on snorkelling ***next*** uh huh that's fine ***next*** but you can come to singapore and use the services of the companies that organise ***next*** for singaporeans to go snorkelling nearby ***next*** 
but um can you give me some tips or ***next*** what are the things that i should remember if i go to your country so that ***next*** the police will not call my attention or ***next*** uh say again ***next*** 
what are the things that i should remember if i go to your country so that ***next*** the police will not call my attention or ***next*** uh say again ***next*** sorry ***next***

so you know they have a little gadget for holding your ashes when you are smoking ***next*** uh i've seen a tourist used it ***next*** i thought it was very cute ***next*** you ***next*** 
you ***next*** so that you can smoke uh at designated areas ***next*** but if there's no bin to dispose of your cigarette after you smoke ***next*** you just keep it back in the container ***next*** 
so it's usually outdoors ***next*** so it will be clearly marked out ***next*** so you have to seat in that area which means if there are only 3 tables and they are taken ***next*** then you have to go to a nonsmoking area and you cannot smoke there ***next***

a double room ***next*** a double bed and a single bed ***next*** that means one of you sleeps in a bigger bed ***next*** it's that's fifty nine dollars ***next*** 
so uh is it near the airport ***next*** uh no ***next*** but you can get there easily by taking the trains ***next*** uh from the airport ***next*** 
uh from the airport ***next*** you just need to make a change in the train direction ***next*** if you went for example all the way to chinatown ***next*** so you will have to cha~ ***next*** 
okay i'm ***next*** yes ***next*** uh it's actually at the basement ***next*** the airport ***next***

that is right ***next*** okay ***next*** so when you reach the airport ***next*** you go down to the basement ***next*** 
you go down to the basement ***next*** uh this would be the airport terminals conduc~ ***next*** connecting terminals one two and three ***next*** if you are at a budget hotel ***next*** 
uh budget airport ***next*** you have to take a shuttle to the main airport and then go to the bus stat~ ***next*** to the um train station ***next*** and ***next*** 
and ***next*** to give you an idea ***next*** so all this is free ***next*** and then you travel along the east line towards the west ***next*** 
to give you an idea ***next*** so all this is free ***next*** and then you travel along the east line towards the west ***next*** can you see tanah merah on the second stop ***next*** 
hm tanah merah yes ***next*** okay ***next*** so that is where you change to go down to town to the west ***next*** towards the west ***next*** 
so that is where you change to go down to town to the west ***next*** towards the west ***next*** and you go down to ***next*** just give me a minute ***next***

outrum park ***next*** yah ***next*** quantrum park is that ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yah ***next*** quantrum park is that ***next*** yes ***next*** o u r t ***next***

what else ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** okay little india if you are visiting the temples ***next*** 
you avoid from about twelve noon to four o'clock ***next*** they have a break ***next*** so you go early morning or you go in the evening ***next*** and then chinatown you take the same line ***next*** 
like uh ***next*** is there a um something like vietnamese town or just the two of these ***next*** not vietnamese but there is uh kampong glam which you have to go by bus because ***next*** well actually you could go by train ***next***

and you get just one stop at city hall station ***next*** and when you get off ***next*** ask the direction to beach road ***next*** so not only do you walk towards the malay quarter or rather the historic uh quarter for the malays ***next*** 
ah okay ***next*** so it wouldn't matter if we just stroll around at three o'clock in the morning something like that ***next*** yah no problem ***next*** uh no problem at all ***next***

may be about 50 minutes or so ***next*** f you plan it correctly ***next*** so you look at the train timing ***next*** uh you see the first line kranji ***next*** 
but the alternative is if you miss this ***next*** you take the public bus and then you have to walk about half a kilometre from where the bus stops to the reserve ***next*** if you take this bus ***next*** it drops you right outside ***next*** 
some day as they charge one dollar ***next*** i might be wrong on that ***next*** it's no more than one dollar anyway ***next*** which is nothing you know ***next*** 
producing goats milk ***next*** uh and uh yes ***next*** so if you catch the bus on it's whole journey ***next*** you get to visit the other farms ***next***

yes ***next*** uh then you can go to other attractions you see ***next*** but if i only have like a budget of maybe right a thousand dollars would it get me to a lot of places though ***next*** uh you may have to downgrade your hotel ***next*** 
uh then you can go to other attractions you see ***next*** but if i only have like a budget of maybe right a thousand dollars would it get me to a lot of places though ***next*** uh you may have to downgrade your hotel ***next*** uh since you are able to travel by the mass rapid transit the train system ***next***

okay ***next*** oh i've heard about sentosa okay ***next*** so you could do your swimming and other activities ***next*** on sentosa island ***next*** 
so you could do your swimming and other activities ***next*** on sentosa island ***next*** uh we do have also a beach on the mainland singapore ***next*** uh but it's just a simple beach ***next*** 
because um i'm actually looking for white sands and very calm seas ***next*** so how are the beaches in sentosa and mainland singapore ***next*** okay the mainland of singapore we have our beach over at the east coast ***next*** uh so when i said "simple" ***next*** 
so how are the beaches in sentosa and mainland singapore ***next*** okay the mainland of singapore we have our beach over at the east coast ***next*** uh so when i said "simple" ***next*** uh yes we don't have white sand on the east coast beach ***next*** 
okay the mainland of singapore we have our beach over at the east coast ***next*** uh so when i said "simple" ***next*** uh yes we don't have white sand on the east coast beach ***next*** uh yes we have pretty deep sea water around the coastline of singapore ***next*** 
so i would say that is not very calm sea ***next*** okay so i would think uh sentosa beaches would be more to your liking ***next*** because you have a beautiful beach out there in fact there are a few ***next*** uh and also uh very calm because the waters there are pretty calm ***next*** 
um is august a good month to go to sentosa ***next*** how's the weather like in singapore ***next*** uh we have summer the whole year around ***next*** so there is no uh differences on whether you are coming in january or december ***next*** 
uh we have summer the whole year around ***next*** so there is no uh differences on whether you are coming in january or december ***next*** uh in terms of our weather ***next*** just in december the weather gets one degree cooler that's all ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh no we ***next*** fortunately here we don't have uh the natural disaster ***next*** because we yah ***next*** 
um okay it's generally happening in uh the month of november ***next*** uh you can still come because uh although you may have heavy rains ***next*** the rains do uh stop alright after a short while ***next*** uh so we do have people coming to singapore from january to december ***next*** 
yes so it's safe to swim in the lagoons ***next*** and also in the lagoons itself you have these buoys ***next*** so as long as you're just swimming inside the buoys ***next*** you are actually i would say very safe ***next*** 
and also in the lagoons itself you have these buoys ***next*** so as long as you're just swimming inside the buoys ***next*** you are actually i would say very safe ***next*** so if you are looking at the safe place uh to swim and very convenient to the hotels ***next*** 
so as long as you're just swimming inside the buoys ***next*** you are actually i would say very safe ***next*** so if you are looking at the safe place uh to swim and very convenient to the hotels ***next*** uh that would something that i would recommend ***next*** 
uh is snorkelling ***next*** uh is the water in sentosa is it good for snorkelling also ***next*** uh no we ***next*** i would not recommend you to go snorkelling in sentosa ***next*** 
thi~ ***next*** so this is an island right ***next*** sentosa island okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
uh okay so what else can we do on the beach ***next*** uh besides the usual volleyball walking on the beach ***next*** um so what else ***next*** okay on sentosa ***next*** 
so snorkelling is definitely out of the question right ***next*** okay ***next*** that's too bad ***next*** yes ***next*** 
but yah if you can tell me a few more things that we can do maybe ***next*** uh you could convince us to go to sentosa ***next*** okay well uh i think that the your child would be interested in this uh ***next*** attraction called the butterfly park and insect kingdom ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh and in this small little park you get to see all this insects ***next*** and part of inside the park itself you will also be walking through an uh openair ***next*** as you can see you see the butterflies are just parked ***next*** 
okay so these are ***next*** this is a small uh but very compact butterfly kingdom ***next*** uh butterfly park and insect kingdom ***next*** and i think if your son is uh very much into a little bit more adventurous and a little bit more exciting ***next*** 
i see ***next*** so this is also found on the island itself ***next*** so you don't have to travel you know to many areas ***next*** uh you can do a lot of things just on the island itself alright ***next*** 
so you don't have to travel you know to many areas ***next*** uh you can do a lot of things just on the island itself alright ***next*** so this is one of them and another attraction you would also be interested in this ***next*** it's called the skyline luge ***next*** 
okay and what's that ***next*** okay this is like uh a bit like bumper cars ***next*** oh sky okay ***next*** yah but you are going downslope ***next*** 
oh sky okay ***next*** yah but you are going downslope ***next*** okay you are going downslope ***next*** so it's really exciting uh if you get on to this luge ***next*** 
so it's really exciting uh if you get on to this luge ***next*** and you can do a oneway luge and the other way by uh skyline is the openair cable car ***next*** kind of a thing yah ***next*** so these are the some of the games or sport you can do on uh sentosa itself ***next*** 
alright ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
okay this merlion is a symbol of singapore ***next*** uh half lion and half fish tail okay ***next*** and yes so you can actually do uh a sort of uh go inside the lion ***next*** and take the lift right up to the mouth of lion ***next*** 
alri~ ***next*** um i'm guessing there is a fee for this right ***next*** how much is it ***next*** okay the admission into this merlion park is eight dollars for an adult ***next*** 
and five dollars for child ***next*** so if your child is ten yes that would be child rate ***next*** oh that's uh singaporean dollars right ***next*** yes everything will be in singapore dollars ***next*** 
it's about a one point two seven at today's rate ***next*** okay alright good ***next*** okay so uh there are other attractions but i will uh you know skip that ***next*** as you can see right there are a lot more attraction on uh sentosa itself ***next*** 
i do ***next*** okay we have uh the song of the sea that comes on every night ***next*** um hm the song of the sea ***next*** yah it's call ***next*** 
um hm the song of the sea ***next*** yah it's call ***next*** is a show it's a water laser and fire show ***next*** that comes on in the night time ***next*** 
seven forty okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so that is the show that you may want to do ***next*** and of course we have a theme park called universal studio on sentosa island ***next*** 
oh it's on sentosa island the universal studios ***next*** it's not on the mainland uh singapore ***next*** yes ***next*** yes ***next*** 
oh we don't really have like a peak season ***next*** uh maybe you get a little bit more crowd in june and december because ***next*** that is also our school holidays here in singapore ***next*** uh and of course some of the public holidays um then you get uh more local people ***next*** 
that is also our school holidays here in singapore ***next*** uh and of course some of the public holidays um then you get uh more local people ***next*** otherwise uh i think it would be fairly uh ***next*** it is not like really crowded if you are going into uh the theme park ***next*** 
wow okay ***next*** yes ***next*** uh yah we don't have major holidays except on the ninth of august ***next*** that's our birthday in august ***next*** 
uh ninth on the ninth of august ***next*** ninth of august that's perfect ***next*** yes ***next*** yes and we do have a big birthday parade um uh in singapore ***next*** 
i'm guessing it's better on a weekday ***next*** uh yes uh of course weekday then you don't have to um have a queue uh in the ***next*** of course the more popular rides like the transformer rides ***next*** so weekday i would say uh yes we get lesser crowd ***next*** 
that's good news so unless if i'm going there ***next*** um for two days and let say friday saturday ***next*** the best time to go to universal studios would be on the friday ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh there are some hotels uh just within the universal studio area ***next*** there are some uh hotels out there okay ***next*** so you can choose to stay uh there as well ***next*** 
okay um ***next*** uh are there any fourstar hotels uh on the island ***next*** uh no we don't have a fourstar hotel um ***next*** the resort world hotel would be i would say they are different category of hotel ***next***

um and ***next*** right ***next*** okay there is one more hotel ***next*** remember earlier on i showed you the beach ***next*** 
i wanna see what's around this hotel or this resort ***next*** the rooms ***next*** oh the location ***next*** okay the location ***next***

so now if we go the mainland what can we do there ***next*** what can we see ***next*** alright ***next*** okay what do your wife yourself and your child like to see ***next*** 
i guess um if uh actually sentosa would be probably for me and for my son ***next*** but if we go the mainland i guess that will be for my wife ***next*** and she likes to shop so where can we to go shopping ***next*** alright ***next*** 
but if we go the mainland i guess that will be for my wife ***next*** and she likes to shop so where can we to go shopping ***next*** alright ***next*** okay we had lots of shopping options in singapore ***next*** 
so hm a lot of us goes to this road called orchard road to do our shopping ***next*** okay ***next*** alright i've heard of that ***next*** and yes ***next*** 
oh i see ***next*** okay ***next*** yes and what would ***next*** what does she likes to shop for ***next*** 
uh are there any places here or roads where they have bargain like for shops or the market ***next*** uh we don't really call our shops market here ***next*** uh but just on the junction of this building uh ion ***next*** uh beside the main road is orchard road the other road is scotts road ***next*** 
uh but just on the junction of this building uh ion ***next*** uh beside the main road is orchard road the other road is scotts road ***next*** so if you just walk down uh you will come to this shopping mall called the um uh far east shopping centre ***next*** okay now this sell uh the i would say the budget and midrange kind of products ***next*** 
uh so it's not like the high fashion ***next*** uh the other place that i would like to recommend uh for the cheaper options of shopping ***next*** would be bugis alright ***next*** uh so this is an area another area again it's the shopping mall ***next*** 
um uh war museums ***next*** not too much war museums but if you have any science museums or a technology museums ***next*** my son is more interested in science actually ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay so this is uh a visit to the science centre and it's quite interactive as well ***next*** uh again it's very accessible ***next*** you can take the subway again the mrt and goes towards the western part of singapore ***next*** so this is the science centre and your son will ***next*** 
well enjoy like a few hours uh in this science centre itself alright ***next*** so i'm going to show you like what are the exhibitions ***next*** okay in here there are all very interactive ***next*** okay inside here ***next***

alright and how much will it cost me to take the mrt in one direction ***next*** okay our mrt is charge as well based on uh distance travel ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
uh the standard ticket and what's that ***next*** is that like an allday pass ***next*** uh no ***next*** you just buy like a per trip basis ***next*** 
uh is there uh a ticket like an allday where i can use that ***next*** and i can go anywhere i want uh with that ticket no ***next*** uh we have like uh not the one day pass ***next*** uh but we have like a tourist pass ***next***

uh on the balcony ***next*** but i have seen it the bal ***next*** the ***next*** where the long bath is ***next*** 
it is shielded by plants ***next*** and they claimed they have done research ***next*** where the tall buildings you know ***next*** they overlook but they can't really see you bathing ***next*** 
they overlook but they can't really see you bathing ***next*** uh so it's very unique ***next*** uh so you may call it a budget hotel ***next*** but it's also known as a boutique hotel ***next*** 
well i'm ***next*** i must see that location you told me the long bath with the ***next*** you know in the outside with the mirror on it ***next*** i ***next*** 
oh yes ***next*** i saw it right now ***next*** okay ***next*** i also have another titbit for you ***next*** 
that we'll land in singapore we want to go there ***next*** how do i go to the hotel nineteen twenty nine ***next*** okay ***next*** um let me get you the mass rapid transit map ***next*** 
sure please do ***next*** i would like to see how to go there ***next*** so that to avoid delays in our trip ***next*** and so since you have quite a nice hotel ***next*** 
uh i suggest you come in by train ***next*** and use the trains and the buses to move around ***next*** because many of our buses like ***next*** ninety nine point nine nine are ***next*** 
because many of our buses like ***next*** ninety nine point nine nine are ***next*** per cent are airconditioned ***next*** almost all are airconditioned now ***next*** 
ninety nine point nine nine are ***next*** per cent are airconditioned ***next*** almost all are airconditioned now ***next*** uh unless the air conditioner uh breaks down ***next*** 
yes ***next*** i can see it now ***next*** okay ***next*** can you see on the righthand side sort of in the middle ***next*** 
okay ***next*** that's where you would start taking your train ride ***next*** so what you do is when you arrived ***next*** change your money at the airport ***next*** 
it's mass rapid transit ***next*** that's the name of our rail system ***next*** so there you approach the officer ***next*** and buy a ezlink ticket ***next*** 
and you also get a discount uh ins~ ***next*** and you also get a discount uh ins~ ***next*** and if you use cash ***next*** it's a bit more expensive ***next*** 
hm i see ***next*** because uh after you stored value when you return ***next*** they charge you a small fee for the manufacture of the card ***next*** but you get your refund back of the unused portion ***next*** 
wow ***next*** that's good ***next*** so probably i will just buy the ezlink one ***next*** yes ***next*** 
that's good ***next*** so probably i will just buy the ezlink one ***next*** yes ***next*** that's right ***next*** 
that's right ***next*** you buy for all three of you ***next*** yes ***next*** you will have to buy adult tickets ***next*** 
you can get off there and have a look around there ***next*** but otherwise you continue down to ***next*** no let me see ***next*** yes ***next*** 
no let me see ***next*** yes ***next*** you get off at city hall and you switch to the red line to dhoby ghaut ***next*** can you see dhoby ghaut at number eight ***next*** 
can you see dhoby ghaut at number eight ***next*** yes ***next*** so is this a train station also ***next*** yes ***next*** 
it's also a very big shopping centre uh with restaurants cafes ***next*** a little garden nearby as well ***next*** so at dhoby ghaut you will just take two stops ***next*** down to chinatown ***next*** 
or you know just as estimation ***next*** e~ ***next*** it's very fast on the trains ***next*** uh maybe forty minutes considering you come in at non peak hours ***next*** 
as long as we can go to chinatown and ***next*** you know take some rest ***next*** and you are not staying too many days ***next*** so you just carry a backpack or you know small luggage you can ***next*** 
yah that's right ***next*** uh just you know ***next*** want to sightseeing and also want to eat something different ***next*** do you mind chinese food ***next*** 
actually no ***next*** what kind of that ***next*** what kind of dish is that ***next*** uh it ***next*** 
uh it ***next*** i ***next*** uh it's a special dialect kind of food ***next*** the cold crab is tasty ***next*** 
the cold crab is tasty ***next*** people are used to chili crab ***next*** but if you don't like chili ***next*** this is a little bit uh closer to not hurting your taste buds ***next*** 
people are used to chili crab ***next*** but if you don't like chili ***next*** this is a little bit uh closer to not hurting your taste buds ***next*** uh it has got gravy to go with it as well ***next*** 
but if you don't like chili ***next*** this is a little bit uh closer to not hurting your taste buds ***next*** uh it has got gravy to go with it as well ***next*** uh except that the cold crab is in fact raw ***next*** 
that one it should be cooked rather than ***next*** that one it should be cooked rather than ***next*** you know i don't want to upset my stomach ***next*** okay ***next*** 
that one it should be cooked rather than ***next*** you know i don't want to upset my stomach ***next*** okay ***next*** alright then ***next*** 
uh there is also something called jelly pork ***next*** uh the pork you know ***next*** when you cook you get these gravies that form a jelly ***next*** and it's very tasty ***next*** 
i just must taken out of that in terms of budgeting ***next*** uh they have also something like ***next*** deep fried pork and liver roll ***next*** and uh yam paste ***next*** 
uh yam paste is quite a sweet dessert ***next*** the yam is cooked uh ***next*** that would be the ending of your meal ***next*** so if you have eaten too much you can skip the dessert ***next*** 
do you know any places there ***next*** a place there that we can bought souvenirs ***next*** you know kinda like tshirts ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** all over ***next*** when you walk out of your hotel and you walk down the main road ***next*** you will find that there are lots of little ***next***

uh get off the train and you get on to a bus ***next*** uh when you reached the bus stop at the back ***next*** there will be signs to tell you the buses that stops there and the route it's going ***next*** so you have to look for one that says "alexandra road" and "hortpark" ***next***

okay ***next*** and you get off there ***next*** that's a very interesting historic area ***next*** uh before you go to the merlion ***next*** 
a big museum for singaporeans to enjoy ***next*** both of them would be combined ***next*** um you can walk from there towards the seaward side ***next*** and uh you would be able to see the merlion ***next*** 
so ***next*** uh huh ***next*** and you get to see views uh of the hotel marina bay sands ***next*** very scenic ***next***

you can both be very happy ***next*** well that's good to hear ***next*** so probably we'll just gonna eat there also together with his brother ***next*** e~ ***next*** 
so that we can you know stroll walk on the seashore ***next*** the area where the merlion is is actually where we have the seafront ***next*** uh but the seafront that you see is now a reservoir ***next*** to collect rainwater that falls in the city area and also to prevent flooding ***next*** 
war history or do you want to see a museum about uh local lifestyle ***next*** well maybe a local lifestyle first ***next*** a cultural type ***next*** okay ***next***

you take the yellow line all the way to botanic gardens ***next*** uh huh ***next*** aw ***next*** that's also quite romantic for proposal ***next*** 
that's right ***next*** it's ***next*** also more of uh open space ***next*** whereas if you reached hortpark and it's raining ***next*** 
because you know when you have your camera flash on ***next*** it's uh it fades the photograph ***next*** uh the exhibits ***next*** and i ***next*** 
it's uh it fades the photograph ***next*** uh the exhibits ***next*** and i ***next*** maybe for security also ***next***

so beautiful ***next*** it's a ***next*** yah ***next*** it's a national monument ***next*** 
how they build it ***next*** it's just like a medieval time ***next*** yes ***next*** uh it is in fact shaped like a cross if you are in a helicopter above it ***next*** 
because they cannot expand the church because it's a protected building ***next*** so there is a sunken area on the other side of the building ***next*** where they have uh ***next*** they use for other purposes when they have not enough space within the church ***next*** 
different location other churches that is available ***next*** uh the catholic churches are just within walking distance across the road from there ***next*** and they were all built in the eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds ***next*** so they are a bit like this ***next*** 
so they are a bit like this ***next*** in fact more on it because you know catholics have lots of statues of saints ***next*** and the way of the cross along the walls ***next*** so it's great for photography ***next*** 
in fact more on it because you know catholics have lots of statues of saints ***next*** and the way of the cross along the walls ***next*** so it's great for photography ***next*** the priest will allow it ***next***

okay ***next*** okay this one is in the region of uh approximately uh about a hundred and fifteen dollars ***next*** per night ***next*** yes per night ***next*** 
yes it's about a hundred and twenty five dollars ***next*** so if you are talking about very close and this hotel is possible to walk to the uh harbourfront ***next*** wow ***next*** okay now if you wanna a lit~ ***next*** 
okay it's located in the financial district area ***next*** okay ***next*** so this would be uh a nicer hotel alright ***next*** it is still convenient to get there ***next*** 
so this would be uh a nicer hotel alright ***next*** it is still convenient to get there ***next*** but otherwise uh most of the hotels are even in orchard road ***next*** is not that difficult to get to the harbourfront ***next*** 
is not that difficult to get to the harbourfront ***next*** oh i see ***next*** so eh this one in m hotel how much it will cost us ***next*** uh this would be in the region of two hundred over uh dollars ***next***

okay uh eighty dollars ***next*** do you mind staying in a backpackers' hotel ***next*** yah i don't see any problem with that ***next*** okay we do have uh backpackers' hotel in singapore ***next*** 
as close as possible ***next*** yes ***next*** okay then i would say that uh there is a hotel called the inns over in chinatown ***next*** i think that would be very close already ***next*** 
um for that hotel it will only cost me less than a dollar ***next*** yes ***next*** uh less than one hundred dollars ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yes you are right in the heart of chinatown ***next*** and is that near in the dining area like a restaurant ***next*** okay because this hote~ ***next*** 
okay because this hote~ ***next*** uh this uh hotel is located in chinatown ***next*** so there are lots of dining options ***next*** there are um uh restaurants ***next*** 
there are um uh restaurants ***next*** quite a lot of chinese restaurants including dimsum just next street ***next*** and all the lanes around the chinatown area ***next*** but if you like to have um street food ***next*** 
um how long it will for us to go to sentosa singapore flyer ***next*** and what will be the ride that we can use to go there ***next*** tem~ ***next*** okay uh this is very conveniently located ***next*** 
and what will be the ride that we can use to go there ***next*** tem~ ***next*** okay uh this is very conveniently located ***next*** uh the closest one of course would be the chinatown mrt ***next*** 
okay uh this is very conveniently located ***next*** uh the closest one of course would be the chinatown mrt ***next*** the other ho~ ***next*** uh mrt would be tanjong pagar ***next*** 
uh mrt would be tanjong pagar ***next*** now tanjong pagar is actually the eastwest line that you will take ***next*** to go to the um harbourfront alright ***next*** uh but if you are sorry ***next*** 
uh but if you are sorry ***next*** uh no you take the chinatown uh station and go to the harbourfront ***next*** um but let say you are going to take uh to the singapore flyer ***next*** then you will have to take from tanjong pagar and alight at the city hall ***next*** 
okay ***next*** oh i see ***next*** so um in sentosa we just need to take the same subway right ***next*** uh on sentosa island we don't have subway ***next*** 
uh which uh visa are you talking about ***next*** um from here in our country to ***next*** for us to go to singapore ***next*** okay for your uh and you are uh holding a philippine passport ***next*** 
okay for your uh and you are uh holding a philippine passport ***next*** yes ***next*** okay you won't require a visa to come to singapore ***next*** and sentosa island is our one of our island ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay again i think it depends on which airline that you are taking ***next*** uh ya really very much depending of the airlines that you are taking ***next*** or would you be able to ***next*** 
uh so there's no uh really specific time ***next*** okay maybe i'll just give you a run down um ***next*** i would say that it will be good to time your holidays uh together with our major festivals here ***next*** like february or january period will be chinese new year ***next*** 
and christmas time is also a very festive because ***next*** uh we light up the whole street of orchard road ***next*** so it gives you that very festive mood ***next*** um the rest of the hari raya deepavali we light up other streets in singapore ***next*** 
you don't have any festival ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** yah we don't have major festival in the month of april ***next*** 
um can you tell me more about that eh ***next*** um how long um it will take for us to go there from the hotel that you gave it to u~ ***next*** uh to the hotel that you gave it to me ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay you will have to uh ***next*** the mrt ride will take you approximately about forty five minutes ***next*** to get to the northern part of singapore ***next*** 
the mrt ride will take you approximately about forty five minutes ***next*** to get to the northern part of singapore ***next*** and you will alight at the mrt train station called the ang mo kio station ***next*** and from there you change a bus number one three eight ***next*** 
and from there you change a bus number one three eight ***next*** to get to the night safari ***next*** so it will be better for you to allocate at least about one and a half hours ***next*** from the hotel to the night safari park ***next*** 
the entrance fee will be thirty two dollars for an adult ***next*** and a child will be twenty one dollars ***next*** that already include the tram ride ***next*** yes the tram ride is included uh for the uh price that i have quoted you ***next*** 
that means the animals are not tame ***next*** so uh yes we do not uh encourage anyone to feed the animals ***next*** they are welltaken care of uh by the zoo keepers ***next*** uh and they have uh regular feeding time ***next*** 
uh and they have uh regular feeding time ***next*** so we don't want the animals to put on too much weight ***next*** and they will be eating the wrong kind food if we give them the human food ***next*** so they have special uh food that the zoo keepers will feed them ***next*** 
hm so fla~ ***next*** the flash of to the camera is not allowed for ***next*** when we take pictures ***next*** uh we do not uh want to damage the eyes of these uh nocturnal creatures ***next*** 
the flash of to the camera is not allowed for ***next*** when we take pictures ***next*** uh we do not uh want to damage the eyes of these uh nocturnal creatures ***next*** because being nocturnal creatures they have very sharp uh eyesight ***next*** 
so we don't want to damage uh their eyes ***next*** and that's why we don't want any flash photographies on the animals ***next*** but if you want to take pictures of your friends or uh just the backdrop uh without the animals ***next*** yes then you can take uh pictures with the flash ***next*** 
uh to us ***next*** i would be ***next*** you see this tram ride ***next*** on the tram ride the malayan tapir comes very close to the tram right ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so you can see uh the spots alright ***next*** every spot of the leopard ***next*** uh so i think there are lot of nice uh animals that you can see but ***next*** 
okay now when you are in the night safari you get on the tram ride ***next*** now in the middle of the tram ride there is a stop ***next*** so you can get off and do a short walk for about thirty minutes ***next*** and you get to see the leopard up close and personal ***next*** 
now in the middle of the tram ride there is a stop ***next*** so you can get off and do a short walk for about thirty minutes ***next*** and you get to see the leopard up close and personal ***next*** now when you finish this walk just come back to the main entrance ***next*** 
and board another tram and that would bring you back to the main entrance ***next*** now again on the screen you can see there is fishing cat trail ***next*** if you're not too tired you can do this trail and the trail would take you about twenty minutes ***next*** and again the last trail it will be the forest giant trail right ***next*** 
yah ***next*** wow ***next*** i don't think so that we'll be uh feel tired if ever that we go there ***next*** yes ***next*** 
we'll just show you some of the animals that will be coming up ***next*** hm wow ***next*** wow lovely ***next*** alright ***next*** 
just the smaller animals uh for you to see uh a little bit closer alright ***next*** um so they will be just doing um what they normally do like feeding you know how do they ***next*** uh take their food ***next*** um yah ***next*** 
so these are just things that they do ***next*** otherwise this is the fire show ***next*** uh it is comes on every night um and they will be performing at the front ***next*** at the entrance of the night safari park ***next*** 
more than hour in advance ***next*** yes ***next*** and so um that will only cost me again how much ***next*** okay their show is included ***next*** 
so we also allowed to um ***next*** uh what about in the show itself ***next*** are we allowed to touch um the small lion ***next*** uh no ***next*** 
uh no ***next*** uh like i sa~ ***next*** mention all the animals in the night safari park are wild animals ***next*** so only the zoo keepers allowed to touch them ***next*** 
until twelve midnight ***next*** twelve midnight yes ***next*** are we able to go there to all these uh beautiful spot that you show me ***next*** yes you uh ***next*** 
twelve midnight yes ***next*** are we able to go there to all these uh beautiful spot that you show me ***next*** yes you uh ***next*** from seven thirty to twelve midnight ***next*** 
from seven thirty to twelve midnight ***next*** you definitely have a lot of time uh to see everything in the night safari park ***next*** but i don't uh ***next*** you don't really need to stay until twelve pm ***next*** 
so it's enough ***next*** three hours is okay right ***next*** for three hours is actually uh enough ***next*** uh to see everything in the night safari park ***next*** 
that is sufficient ***next*** is that safe to travel again to go back to the hotel ***next*** yes ***next*** uh ten thirty you can still take the public bus ***next*** 
but ***next*** so that's great to hear ***next*** so um i will make sure that i will go the singapore night safari ***next*** okay and we have our latest of addition we have a baby giraffe that is just born ***next***

earlier on the uh this ultimate skate park that is free ***next*** uh ifly i think it's still very reasonable ***next*** considering that it's very really exciting to do that ***next*** um and i think borderx is still very affordable as well ***next*** 
now again the skate park you could combine that with the uh swim ***next*** over at the east coast area and the cable ski ***next*** alright ***next*** because they are located in the same location ***next*** 
okay ***next*** ah okay ***next*** can you give me some ***next*** right ***next*** 
okay of course uh we have closer to uh the orchard belt area ***next*** we have chinatown ***next*** and aside chinese ***next*** this is chinatown ***next***

a lot of them were illiterate ***next*** so they could not speak or write english ***next*** and neither not every one of the chinese could speak or write mandarin ***next*** they would be speaking in their local dialect ***next*** 
so we can see how ***next*** uh what kind of living conditions they were living in um in the ***next*** uh chinatown heritage centre ***next*** okay so uh this is the chinatown uh heritage centre yah ***next***

so these are uh chilli crabs different recipes of chilli crab ***next*** and uh this is something that a lot of the locals like to eat ***next*** so yes i would say chilli crab will be something hm very unique to singapore ***next*** or the other version would be pepper crab ***next*** 
i just uh i can buy res~ ***next*** can buy it in any restaurant there right ***next*** yes most of the seafood restaurant would be able to cook for you ***next*** uh pepper crab or um uh chili crabs ***next*** 
yah ***next*** right ***next*** it's not that expensive ***next*** they normally uh the price will be charged according ***next***

uh it is just about two bus stop ***next*** and you have to just walk up a hill call 'kit chandu ***next*** so what do you call that museum ***next*** uh it's called bukit chandu ***next***

yah so all these are uh hostel that i'm talking about ***next*** uh they are below fifty dollars price range ***next*** okay this one here prince of whale it's in the um ***next*** another ethnic area the little india area ***next***

just about ten minutes from the financial district area ***next*** we have uh world famous ku dÉ ta that's at the uh marina bay sands resort ***next*** something a little bit cheaper would be double o ***next*** okay that's at the queen street area ***next*** 
we have just drinking places ***next*** oh i see ***next*** yah so there are drinking places by the beach ***next*** uh that serve wine cocktail soft drinks ***next*** 
acoustic music um hm ***next*** hiphop ***next*** just acoustic ***next*** homegrown ***next*** 
homegrown ***next*** yah ***next*** yup homegrown ***next*** okay we have uh club ***next*** 
well i guess that bar isn't it ***next*** that bar is not expensive ***next*** no it's not so expensive ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** well the location ***next*** i don't think i have the pictures for you to see ***next*** uh but this is uh located um just at uh boat quay area ***next*** 
i don't think i have the pictures for you to see ***next*** uh but this is uh located um just at uh boat quay area ***next*** the southern part of singapore ***next*** so there are quite a few uh bars and clubs ***next*** 
uh but this is uh located um just at uh boat quay area ***next*** the southern part of singapore ***next*** so there are quite a few uh bars and clubs ***next*** uh located uh around the clarke quay area ***next*** 
oh no you don't need the tour guide for your uh clubbing right ***next*** just grab a few friends and you're done ***next*** or well there are always uh likeminded people over in all these clubs ***next*** so this is uh hiphop and r and b ***next*** 
yup ***next*** for how many hours ***next*** i mean it's an hour ***next*** uh just an half an hour ride ***next*** 
uh that would be fifteen dollars ***next*** oh good ***next*** uh i thought it will be cost in hundred ***next*** uh no ***next*** 
okay so this is the ***next*** just to tone down things a little bit ***next*** uh you can just take a river cruise ***next*** uh that would cost you fifteen dollars ***next*** 
uh different scenery ***next*** okay you are just looking at different scenery ***next*** uh in the night time ***next*** uh you get to see the lights and there's a commentary on the cruise itself ***next*** 
okay you are just looking at different scenery ***next*** uh in the night time ***next*** uh you get to see the lights and there's a commentary on the cruise itself ***next*** uh like i said you know since you are going to do so much exciting things in singapore ***next*** 
i don't know whether you see this boat out there ***next*** and the buildings behind is actually is boat quay ***next*** so if you are taking in the daytime this cruise ***next*** then of course it's a totally different kind of scenery ***next*** 
so if you are taking in the daytime this cruise ***next*** then of course it's a totally different kind of scenery ***next*** the night cruise when all the lights comes on ***next*** and again a different view of uh singapore on the river itself ***next*** 
i guess that's it ***next*** okay ***next*** you give me a lot of information that it helps me a lot ***next*** yah so you have to come back a few times huh not just one okay ***next*** 
bye ***next*** alright ***next*** welco~ ***next*** okay same to you ***next*** 
how can i help you ***next*** um well you see my husband and i will be celebrating our wedding anniversary coming may ***next*** and we're sort of thinking um going on a tour in asia maybe ***next*** uh can i have your dates again please ***next*** 
will probably be singapore ***next*** i have heard a lot of good things about it and maybe that's a very good place to start ***next*** yes singapore is a hub for the rest of southeast asia ***next*** uh we have also very good connections by air and by sea ***next*** 
alright ***next*** so for this particular tour since we're gonna probably bring along our daughter with us ***next*** we're sort of thinking um probably going to a theme park maybe ***next*** a theme park okay ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh but at four years old uh ***next*** some of the rides she may not be able to take ***next*** you can visit the theme parks but uh like the roller coaster rides and all that ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so what you're seeing is an aviary ***next*** where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park ***next*** and this the night safari tram ride ***next*** 
so what you're seeing is an aviary ***next*** where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park ***next*** and this the night safari tram ride ***next*** which you can take uh if you are too tired to walk ***next*** 
where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park ***next*** and this the night safari tram ride ***next*** which you can take uh if you are too tired to walk ***next*** or you can walk as well as you know take the ride ***next*** 
and this the night safari tram ride ***next*** which you can take uh if you are too tired to walk ***next*** or you can walk as well as you know take the ride ***next*** you can do both if you have time ***next*** 
so what time does the night safari usually open ***next*** if ***next*** uh you can go in a little bit earlier but they won't let you ride inside ***next*** to take the tram ride until after the sun goes down which is seven o'clock ***next*** 
now this is the day zoo ***next*** can you see elephants of asia ***next*** yup i surely can ***next*** so this is one of the shows that you see at the zoo ***next*** 
yup i surely can ***next*** so this is one of the shows that you see at the zoo ***next*** which is next to the night safari ***next*** so you should visit ***next*** 
so this is one of the shows that you see at the zoo ***next*** which is next to the night safari ***next*** so you should visit ***next*** uh if she likes the zoo very much ***next*** 
uh if she likes the zoo very much ***next*** because they have a children's uh playground area in there ***next*** and she can take a little uh like a train around the zoo uh in the children's playground ***next*** she can also uh see ***next*** 
and she can take a little uh like a train around the zoo uh in the children's playground ***next*** she can also uh see ***next*** you know pet the little animals ***next*** the small ones that are like rabbits and uh pygmy horses you know ***next*** 
um like feeding the animals or riding the small animals maybe ***next*** yes there are uh times where you can ride the elephants ***next*** or the horses in the zoo ***next*** uh at night we have a tribal show uh at the night safari ***next*** 
yes that's right they ***next*** because they are run under one organisation known as wildlife reserves ***next*** so it is one ***next*** under one umbrella organisation ***next*** 
wow ***next*** um can you tell me more about um the river safari ***next*** okay river safari is new ***next*** and it takes you from one part of the zoo ***next*** 
to another part ***next*** and you're lucky because it has just opened ***next*** so of course you're not going to go to all those rivers that was shown just now ***next*** but it's a simulation ***next*** 
so of course you're not going to go to all those rivers that was shown just now ***next*** but it's a simulation ***next*** um okay ***next*** so here you go you can see uh crocodiles ***next*** 
and on the boat ride the guide will show you um you know the skin ***next*** the moult of the uh snakes ***next*** things that you don't normally see when you uh just visit a zoo ***next*** but when you take the ride you can see exhibits that they have collected ***next*** 
oh i see ***next*** that sounds really nice ***next*** i'm ***next*** now the panda that you just saw ***next*** 
that sounds really nice ***next*** i'm ***next*** now the panda that you just saw ***next*** they have not yet come ***next*** 
they have not yet come ***next*** uh okay ***next*** but they are coming okay ***next*** so we are just uh waiting for them arrive ***next*** 
uh the river safari is uh a new trail ***next*** they had a river ride all along but now they have enhanced it ***next*** oh i see ***next*** so you see at the bottom there the different zones ***next*** 
so they are trying to recreate these zones within the river safari ***next*** it seems to me as if this is gonna be a very big place ***next*** uh yes it is ***next*** uh it's uh forty hectares if i remember correctly the riv~ ***next*** 
the whole zoo ***next*** oh my goodness ***next*** yah ***next*** uh they actually have ninety hectares in total ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh they actually have ninety hectares in total ***next*** but they haven't develop the whole area ***next*** so uh the night safari uh ***next*** 
uh they actually have ninety hectares in total ***next*** but they haven't develop the whole area ***next*** so uh the night safari uh ***next*** shall i show you pictures of that ***next*** 
it's actually token feeding ***next*** it's to encourage the animals to be in the light so you can see ***next*** and some like these tapirs they are tame enough ***next*** for them to roam around along the trails ***next*** 
and some like these tapirs they are tame enough ***next*** for them to roam around along the trails ***next*** so sometimes they stop and uh uh let ***next*** they have to stop to let the tapirs have right of way ***next*** 
'cause like i said my kid just loves animals ***next*** so this is probably something i have to put on my agenda when i go to singapore ***next*** you can take photos in the zoo and the bird park ***next*** but not at the night safari uh at the animals ***next*** 
but not at the night safari uh at the animals ***next*** you can take when they are doing the show ***next*** you can take cozying in the open areas but not at the animals ***next*** because we won't ***next*** 
uh would you know how much this is gonna cost ***next*** to have a package ticket for all of these places that you've just shown me ***next*** okay ***next*** uh do you want to see the zoo ***next*** 
to have a package ticket for all of these places that you've just shown me ***next*** okay ***next*** uh do you want to see the zoo ***next*** did i show you the zoo ***next*** 
okay ***next*** that will work ***next*** that's the naked mole rat ***next*** that's why they called it the nudist colony ***next*** 
make sense ***next*** you won't see naked people there ***next*** don't worry ***next*** okay ***next*** 
are you getting it on your screen ***next*** yes i definitely am ***next*** the three animals at the back that look like hairy monkeys ***next*** they are orangutans ***next*** 
yes i definitely am ***next*** the three animals at the back that look like hairy monkeys ***next*** they are orangutans ***next*** that you normally have to go into the forest to see ***next*** 
uh no ***next*** because uh where you're eating is separate from where they are ***next*** and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating ***next*** so they don't come and help themselves to your food ***next*** 
because uh where you're eating is separate from where they are ***next*** and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating ***next*** so they don't come and help themselves to your food ***next*** you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area ***next*** 
and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating ***next*** so they don't come and help themselves to your food ***next*** you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area ***next*** and you're looking at i think some lemurs at the back ***next*** 
uh so the specimens inside or rather the exhibits inside there ***next*** are all tamed and quite friendly ***next*** that's nice ***next*** including the twotoed sloth ***next*** 
that's nice ***next*** including the twotoed sloth ***next*** you know the very slow moving sloth ***next*** that uh it's up the tree ***next*** 
including the twotoed sloth ***next*** you know the very slow moving sloth ***next*** that uh it's up the tree ***next*** it's very hard to see in the jungle you can see it here ***next*** 
yup ***next*** hm i see ***next*** and we have the sea lions that do a show ***next*** you can get your daughter to take part in the show ***next*** 
hm i see ***next*** and we have the sea lions that do a show ***next*** you can get your daughter to take part in the show ***next*** are you there ***next*** 
you know we'd probably do when we get there ***next*** yah ***next*** you can volunteer uh your daughter ***next*** when they asked for volunteers at the bird park show ***next*** 
you can volunteer uh your daughter ***next*** when they asked for volunteers at the bird park show ***next*** and also at the uh day zoo tour ***next*** and if they selected then she'll be the star of the show ***next*** 
yup ***next*** yes ma'am ***next*** uh oh just hold on a minute ***next*** oh i think it's ***next*** 
uh oh just hold on a minute ***next*** oh i think it's ***next*** wait ***next*** okay ***next*** 
so three in one ***next*** because if you go to all three parks you are paying only fifty eight dollars ***next*** alright ***next*** and if you visit just the night safari and zoo it's forty eight ***next*** 
the only thing is it doesn't ***next*** uh oh it includes the night safari tram ride ***next*** but uh not the tram ride within the day zoo ***next*** so if you want to take a tram within the singapore zoo in the day time ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yes that's right you see ***next*** thirty days to use it up ***next*** so you could even take one at a time ***next*** 
and then just walk across to the night safari ***next*** i see ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh do you want to see pictures of the tram ride ***next*** um i think i'm good ***next*** you're okay huh ***next***

if you're thinking of your daughter ***next*** we have activities within our museums targeted at children ***next*** uh but uh culturals shows no ***next*** we have more the adult theme shows ***next*** 
uh what i'm showing you is actually a show that just shown uh in a resort ***next*** but if you are talking about chinese malay indian dance ***next*** we used to include it on a city tour ***next*** but uh it's not really uh a show that you just go on and see you know ***next*** 
uh the mar~ ***next*** we have a re~ ***next*** big resort on sentosa island ***next*** okay ***next*** 
big resort on sentosa island ***next*** okay ***next*** what you can see ***next*** i don't call it cultural actually ***next*** 
i don't call it cultural actually ***next*** it's uh got uh pyrotechnics ***next*** so if you like the beach and you go to sentosa ***next*** you can see this show ***next*** 
it's uh got uh pyrotechnics ***next*** so if you like the beach and you go to sentosa ***next*** you can see this show ***next*** so it's not the traditional cultural show ***next*** 
so it's not the traditional cultural show ***next*** you know what i mean ***next*** yup ***next*** but your daughter might enjoy this ***next*** 
uh before that uh the people will be encouraging you to sing along with them ***next*** so this is more hightech ***next*** it's what i think people like today ***next*** so you go there in the evening ***next*** 
so you go there in the evening ***next*** can you see the times here at seven ***next*** um yup seven forty ***next*** and eight forty ***next*** 
um yup seven forty ***next*** and eight forty ***next*** and because it's popular ***next*** they have an additional show on saturdays and public holidays ***next*** 
i see ***next*** i might check that out too ***next*** yes ***next*** uh if you go to sentosa island you go to the beach ***next*** 
i might check that out too ***next*** yes ***next*** uh if you go to sentosa island you go to the beach ***next*** this is just uh along the beach ***next*** 
this is just uh along the beach ***next*** um i see ***next*** so what's the difference between your premium seats and your standard seats ***next*** uh i think premium seats are more in the centre and ***next*** 
you are right in the centre so that you can see it very well ***next*** alright ***next*** uh there's another show ***next*** and it's called the voyage de la vie ***next*** 
it is at the sentosa resorts ***next*** can you show that to me as well ***next*** yes just a moment ***next*** so i know i'm not answering your question directly about cultural shows ***next*** 
these are more fun things that uh singaporeans also go to enjoy ***next*** and i have seen this show myself ***next*** uh there's a lot of acrobatics ***next*** uh very spectacular ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so there you see it's uh our longest running show ***next*** hm so how long has it been running there ***next*** oh i can't remember exactly ***next*** 
it's full of activity ***next*** so one and a half of hours ***next*** the story is simple about a young man on a journey ***next*** but it is more ***next*** 
you see the dancing you see the acrobatics ***next*** and this happens like every day ***next*** yes every day uh i think ***next*** uh let me see they must have a day off probably ***next*** 
and this happens like every day ***next*** yes every day uh i think ***next*** uh let me see they must have a day off probably ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** they are taking from wednesday to friday ***next*** from october the first yes ***next*** so that means i think monday and tuesday is their day off ***next*** 
so that means i think monday and tuesday is their day off ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** i ***next*** 
for sure the acrobats they need a break ***next*** so wednesday and friday at eight thirty ***next*** but saturday and sunday they have a matinee show ***next*** uh because it's so popular they want to have a earlier show ***next*** 
uh i think hundred and eight is good enough already ***next*** and that's the same fee for let say ***next*** or do they admit kids like my daughter's age ***next*** they ***next*** 
and that's the same fee for let say ***next*** or do they admit kids like my daughter's age ***next*** they ***next*** yes i think they do let me see ***next*** 
yes ***next*** what about shops ***next*** can you recommend shops maybe that you have ***next*** uh highend shops we have down at orchard road ***next*** 
uh highend shops we have down at orchard road ***next*** which is the main tourist belt with the more expensive hotels or the better class hotels ***next*** uh then we have also shopping malls ***next*** uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront ***next*** 
which is the main tourist belt with the more expensive hotels or the better class hotels ***next*** uh then we have also shopping malls ***next*** uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront ***next*** vivocity is newer ***next*** 
it's ***next*** you can get all the good brands there ***next*** but there are also shops that sell things like g two thousand ***next*** do you know it ***next*** 
do you know it ***next*** yup ***next*** a midprice range ***next*** but the concentration of branded shops would be at orchard road ***next*** 
yup ***next*** a midprice range ***next*** but the concentration of branded shops would be at orchard road ***next*** and also at marina bay sands where that we have a casino ***next*** 
um i was thinking of just you know um checking the shops out and see ***next*** you know what could probably be in~ ***next*** of interest for me and my husband or my kid ***next*** okay if ***next*** 
right on top of it ***next*** yes ***next*** is that an infinity pool ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** is that an infinity pool ***next*** yes ***next*** uh actually infinity pools scare me a little bit ***next*** 
is that an infinity pool ***next*** yes ***next*** uh actually infinity pools scare me a little bit ***next*** i think i'm going to swim right out to see ***next*** 
well don't go near the edge then ***next*** stay away from it ***next*** okay we have here ***next*** uh let me go to the shopping alright ***next*** 
and it's called c k tang ***next*** tangs is the short form t a n g ***next*** and it's at vivocity just in front of sentosa island ***next*** uh here you see ***next*** 
uh here you see ***next*** this is a list of the shops you get at marina bay sands ***next*** uh or rather it's categorised by what you want ***next*** so what is your preference i can select for you ***next*** 
so what is your preference i can select for you ***next*** um what about jewellery ***next*** jewellery ***next*** okay these are the stores we have ***next*** 
jewellery ***next*** okay these are the stores we have ***next*** bulgari uh cartier ***next*** all the branded uh ***next*** 
um i think i'm good ***next*** um maybe we can talk about the hotel next ***next*** okay ***next*** you haven't selected your hotel huh have you ***next*** 
you haven't selected your hotel huh have you ***next*** uh no not yet ***next*** i'm really just at the planning stage right now ***next*** okay but uh ***next*** 
'cause i would rather have as much information as i can at this point ***next*** before we finally decide ***next*** okay ***next*** i want to suggest to you this hotel in chinatown ***next*** 
it is quite romantic ***next*** it is a boutique hotel ***next*** oops ***next*** you see the building was built in nineteen twenty nine hence the name of the hotel ***next*** 
and here you see the facade of the hotel ***next*** it's got bay windows ***next*** the rooms are very interesting ***next*** uh that he even has a suite on the uh top floor ***next*** 
okay ***next*** may ***next*** will there be available rooms ***next*** uh we can check ***next*** 
what day in may are you thinking of ***next*** um probably not a weekend ***next*** uh maybe midweek or something ***next*** not a ***next*** 
wednesday the ninth ***next*** because may day would be on the first ***next*** uh if they have higher rates on that ti~ ***next*** at that time they might be charging a bit more ***next*** 
oh really ***next*** yah ***next*** room ***next*** so are you taking one room or two rooms ***next*** 
yup ***next*** uh one room ***next*** because your daughter is only four ***next*** or we can put it as two guests ***next*** 
yah ***next*** but this hotel is safe right ***next*** i mean ***next*** oh it's very safe ***next*** 
being a very old hotel ***next*** it's not gonna crumble down on me is it ***next*** oh no it's ***next*** uh you saw the picture ***next*** 
and they have uh even a room ***next*** where you can have uh a bath looking out into the sky ***next*** hm that's interesting ***next*** uh i did ***next*** 
that's the one with the bathroom that you were talking about earlier ***next*** yes ***next*** yes ***next*** it's quite fun actually if you are not the shy type ***next*** 
you are ***next*** it is uh quite okay ***next*** you should actually check it out and have a look ***next*** it's just that you know uh this is quite nice ***next*** 
you should actually check it out and have a look ***next*** it's just that you know uh this is quite nice ***next*** because it's right at the top of the hotel ***next*** the hotel has just about three storeys ***next*** 
uh you can also take uh junior suite then ***next*** do you have pictures of that ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** 
uh what was the price of uh your show ***next*** it's a hundred and eight dollars right ***next*** um hm that's for one person right ***next*** but the ***next*** 
yes uh ***next*** so in fact you have ***next*** we have tickets at forty eight dollars if i remember correctly ***next*** uh the junior suite is two hundred plus ***next*** 
so in fact you have ***next*** we have tickets at forty eight dollars if i remember correctly ***next*** uh the junior suite is two hundred plus ***next*** like two hundred and fourteen dollars ***next*** 
so you stay in two days is that right ***next*** right ***next*** so that's gonna be around four hundred already plus you know the addons ***next*** seven hundred over dollars yah ***next*** 
seven hundred over dollars yah ***next*** so ***next*** you have to go down on your uh expectations for the show ***next*** you need to downgrade on your show ***next*** 
can we check those out as well ***next*** okay ***next*** this room is a hundred and ninety six dollars ***next*** deluxe room ***next*** 
this room is a hundred and ninety six dollars ***next*** deluxe room ***next*** okay that will do ***next*** yes that would be under two hundred dollars ***next*** 
yes that would be under two hundred dollars ***next*** how is it different from what's that superior double ***next*** uh superior double ***next*** maybe the fittings i'm not sure ***next*** 
it's a little bit simpler ***next*** i think the deluxe room is a lot better ***next*** don't you think ***next*** yes ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so ***next*** maybe you downgrade on your show price tickets ***next*** so your rooms uh ***next*** 
okay that's the only picture we have of the room ***next*** yah ***next*** so we close this ***next*** so this is the room you want ***next*** 
so this is the room you want ***next*** yup ***next*** yes it's two hundred and fourteen dollars so four hundred and twenty eight dollars ***next*** uh do you want to see the show at forty eight dollars or fifty eight dollars ***next*** 
'cause i was always ***next*** also thinking that two days might not be enough to you know to cover everything ***next*** if you are staying two whole nights ***next*** one night for the night safari and one night for the show ***next*** 
also thinking that two days might not be enough to you know to cover everything ***next*** if you are staying two whole nights ***next*** one night for the night safari and one night for the show ***next*** so let's see the rates ***next*** 
so let's see the rates ***next*** uh the package price is what you want right ***next*** okay ***next*** so yah it's about sixty dollars ***next*** 
uh the package price is what you want right ***next*** okay ***next*** so yah it's about sixty dollars ***next*** it's fifty eight dollars for the three of you ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so yah it's about sixty dollars ***next*** it's fifty eight dollars for the three of you ***next*** uh for one of you ***next*** 
but i see that the price for the kid is uh different ***next*** it's only thirty eight dollars ***next*** oh yes ***next*** thirty eight dollars so it's only a hundred and sixty dollars ***next*** 
almost five hundred dollars ***next*** so i think i have money for the show then ***next*** yes uh ***next*** but not on a hundred and eight ***next*** 
yes uh ***next*** but not on a hundred and eight ***next*** because you want to eat right ***next*** you want to ***next*** 
uh can you downgrade to the fifty eight dollar ticket for the show ***next*** wouldn't that be too far or do you think that's just right ***next*** no it's not too far ***next*** because as i said the hall isn't very big ***next*** 
no it's not too far ***next*** because as i said the hall isn't very big ***next*** and the performers are right in front of you you know ***next*** it is uh ***next*** 
you use this card to pay for your fare so you don't have to use any money ***next*** so you just buy that card and then you use it for your bus and train rides correct ***next*** that's right ***next*** and then before you leave any balance value you can get a refund ***next*** 
and then before you leave any balance value you can get a refund ***next*** so how much do these ez cards cost ***next*** uh at the airport you pay twelve dollars ***next*** here you go can you see ***next*** 
oh there you go ***next*** yah ***next*** and you would have to top up some money so ***next*** or maybe you allow thirty dollars for it just to be safe ***next*** 
so the thirty dollar value that ***next*** do you think that will be enough for the entire duration for the trip ***next*** or um how much just one person usually spend going around ***next*** uh it depends on how far you are going and the places you're going to ***next*** 
um any you know um food places that you'd probably recommend ***next*** we can check out before we go ***next*** that brings you to ***next*** food places ***next*** 
do you like chinese food ***next*** oh i love it ***next*** and this place is a very old market that also has been restored ***next*** and the good thing is you can see food that is being sold ***next*** 
and the people there office workers when you go on a week day ***next*** uh they will be happy to explain to you what they're eating if you need help ***next*** oh that's nice ***next*** so for your daughter maybe five dollars or even three dollars a plate of something ***next*** 
oh that's nice ***next*** so for your daughter maybe five dollars or even three dollars a plate of something ***next*** a dollar juice uh if you like ***next*** soya bean a dollar as a dessert five dollars for her ***next*** 
so for your daughter maybe five dollars or even three dollars a plate of something ***next*** a dollar juice uh if you like ***next*** soya bean a dollar as a dessert five dollars for her ***next*** and for your husband and yourself maybe seven or eight dollars each ***next*** 
and for your husband and yourself maybe seven or eight dollars each ***next*** not bad ***next*** so the food there is good huh ***next*** yes very good ***next***

like steam fish fried fish uh salted egg vegetables ***next*** different vegetables cooked in different ways tofu ***next*** so you pick what you want and you eat it ***next*** uh so it depends on what you pick fish ***next*** 
uh so it depends on what you pick fish ***next*** uh a whole fish of course is more expensive ***next*** if you are just taking a slice is less ***next*** and if your taking vegetables usually it's a dollar or seventy cents a little plate ***next***

the bay grandstand ***next*** um yah ***next*** yes ***next*** the bay grandstand you get a view of the ***next*** 
okay let me tell you the difference ***next*** the bay grandstand you get a view of the uh bay that has been turned into a reservoir ***next*** padang grandstand it is our old colonial district ***next*** you would be able to see maybe a longer stretch of them racing ***next*** 
uh but let me have a look at the tickets first huh ***next*** okay ***next*** no problem ***next*** okay ***next*** 
um that would be for the qualifying and for the night race itself ***next*** or just for the qualifying race ***next*** let me see ***next*** oh it doesn't ***next***

and that ***next*** one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars ***next*** and that's a straight line as well ***next*** straight line yes ***next*** 
one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars ***next*** and that's a straight line as well ***next*** straight line yes ***next*** but you get a very good view of the drivers you know ***next*** 
and that's a straight line as well ***next*** straight line yes ***next*** but you get a very good view of the drivers you know ***next*** if they are overtaking uh doing something rather dangerous ***next*** 
okay ***next*** that i think that sounds good ***next*** um it's two hundred fifty something dollars right ***next*** yes ***next*** 
um it's two hundred fifty something dollars right ***next*** yes ***next*** it's two hundred and forty eight ***next*** so you can say it's about two hundred and fifty dollars ***next***

if you are having a room definitely ***next*** and even the backpackers joints they have air conditioning ***next*** because here we are rather warm and humid ***next*** so air conditioning is like a must in hotels ***next*** 
okay ***next*** that sounds good ***next*** and if you are serious about coming ***next*** i suggest you book the rooms straightaway ***next*** 
do i get a discount or would it still be the regular rate ***next*** uh it depends on the hotel ***next*** uh nowadays the hotels know that this is a peak period ***next*** so i don't think you'll get a discount ***next*** 
uh nowadays the hotels know that this is a peak period ***next*** so i don't think you'll get a discount ***next*** um in the regular hotels in fact you'll have to pay more ***next*** like in the first class hotels uh they charge more ***next*** 
okay ***next*** let me see whether we can get a picture of this ***next*** whether they have rooms for you ***next*** because it says twenty eight dollars which would not be a room i think ***next*** 
let me see whether we can get a picture of this ***next*** whether they have rooms for you ***next*** because it says twenty eight dollars which would not be a room i think ***next*** but uh ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so twenty eight dollars a night ***next*** they have ***next*** uh let's see if they have ***next*** 
so twenty eight dollars a night ***next*** they have ***next*** uh let's see if they have ***next*** they usually show the lowest price ***next*** 
uh let's see if they have ***next*** they usually show the lowest price ***next*** okay ***next*** uh okay ***next*** 
uh okay ***next*** see they have ***next*** oh no ***next*** oh can you see that it's a mix dorm ***next*** 
screen ***next*** yes ***next*** so that would be sixbed mix dorm ***next*** and uh it's thirty three dollars a night ***next*** 
uh that's not gonna go over fifty dollars ***next*** but then it's a single room ***next*** single room for under fifty dollars ***next*** i think that's a bit tough ***next*** 
yah i think that's fine ***next*** 'cause um i still have two hundred fifty dollars to spare for the ro ***next*** for the hotel accommodation ***next*** oh so if you spent ***next*** 
'cause um i still have two hundred fifty dollars to spare for the ro ***next*** for the hotel accommodation ***next*** oh so if you spent ***next*** uh oh you mean if you s~ ***next*** 
for the hotel accommodation ***next*** oh so if you spent ***next*** uh oh you mean if you s~ ***next*** your ticket is two hundred and fifty dollars ***next*** 
for the hotel accommodation ***next*** that's ***next*** wow ***next*** two hundred and fifty dollars will get you a hotel room ***next*** 
in some hotels you would be able to get two nights ***next*** okay ***next*** so let's say less than a hundred dollars ***next*** let us try less than a hundred ***next*** 
it's a good area ***next*** then we have budget class ***next*** uh the first two that states little india ***next*** you are very near to town ***next*** 
oh if you do that you will bust your budget ***next*** uh because if you ***next*** the hotel rates will go up during that time for the budget class hotels ***next*** so ***next*** 
so ***next*** so even though if i book in advance ***next*** let's say a few weeks from now ***next*** even though you book in advan~ ***next*** 
let's say a few weeks from now ***next*** even though you book in advan~ ***next*** no ***next*** even though you book in advance ***next*** 
even though you book in advan~ ***next*** no ***next*** even though you book in advance ***next*** because the hotels know that it's a very popular period ***next*** 
uh so they bill it into the room rates ***next*** so i think your priority to ***next*** is to book your hotel first and ***next*** or tickets ***next*** 
and the rest of it you can use for shopping ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so this is a good hotel ***next*** 
uh santa grand hotel bugis ***next*** it's also just one stop away from the race venue ***next*** it's in a shopping area ***next*** it's also fairly new ***next*** 
and looks uh quite good from the outside ***next*** okay ***next*** so this is a onestar hotel ***next*** uh one or two stars ***next*** 
so this is a onestar hotel ***next*** uh one or two stars ***next*** yah we don't go by the star system in singapore ***next*** because it's too restrictive on pricing ***next*** 
because it's too restrictive on pricing ***next*** but maybe i would call it twostar ***next*** uh lavender street ***next*** let me see ***next*** 
uh be near um the racing venue or far from the racing venue ***next*** wherein i would have ***next*** i would still have to take the train ***next*** it's okay if you take just one stop ***next*** 
wherein i would have ***next*** i would still have to take the train ***next*** it's okay if you take just one stop ***next*** uh and in fact for one stop i think you can walk ***next*** 
um yes ***next*** yes ***next*** so uh that's not a problem ***next*** it's ***next*** 
if it includes a short walk that would be fine ***next*** so i can enjoy the scenery as well ***next*** yes ***next*** that's right ***next*** 
so i can enjoy the scenery as well ***next*** yes ***next*** that's right ***next*** so you can take the ***next*** 
watching the races you can uh take photographs ***next*** of the uh people going there to shop ***next*** the people praying in the hindu temples ***next*** the flower garland makers ***next*** 
the people praying in the hindu temples ***next*** the flower garland makers ***next*** so you can do you know things that tourist normally do ***next*** you'll get a lots of souvenir photographs when you go home ***next*** 
so under five dollars for a good meal ***next*** yes ***next*** i think under five dollars would be more than enough ***next*** if you pay for the breakfast in the hotel ***next*** 
if you pay for the breakfast in the hotel ***next*** i believe they would cost ***next*** it's gonna cost me more ***next*** they would cost you in a higher ***next*** 
they would cost you in a higher ***next*** cost you more and then they put in a buffet spread ***next*** you know jam and eggs and ham and you know ***next*** the stuff that uh hotels normally provide ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so i think i'm gonna enjoy singapore if i eat outside of the hotel ***next*** so ***next*** 
so i think i'm gonna enjoy singapore if i eat outside of the hotel ***next*** so ***next*** yes you will ***next*** so here ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so the hundred and forty dollars ***next*** that's only good for one night ***next*** yes for one night ***next*** 
okay ***next*** 'cause i think i'll be needing two days ***next*** that's right ***next*** if you have two days then you uh little bit more relax you know ***next*** 
that's right ***next*** if you have two days then you uh little bit more relax you know ***next*** after you have landed and you have a bit more time to sightsee ***next*** so two fifty for the tickets ***next*** 
get me um for shopping in singapore ***next*** is that good enough ***next*** uh is that a good enough money or ***next*** if you ***next*** 
i don't have prices for the items ***next*** but there's a centre i will recommend you to ***next*** it's uh an it centre ***next*** so they have laptops they have the peripherals ***next*** 
um would be a good souvenir to buy let's say when i get back ***next*** uh one of the souvenirs that should people normally buy ***next*** is of the merlion uh sort of ***next*** uh just an ornament to put on the table ***next*** 
is of the merlion uh sort of ***next*** uh just an ornament to put on the table ***next*** and how much do they usually cost ***next*** uh depends on the size of the item ***next*** 
and how much do they usually cost ***next*** uh depends on the size of the item ***next*** they have them really small for people who want tiny things ***next*** and they have them bigger ***next*** 
and it depends on you know what it is made of ***next*** so if you go to a good class store ***next*** it might cost you fifteen twenty dollars ***next*** if you buy it on the street side ***next*** 
so if you go to a good class store ***next*** it might cost you fifteen twenty dollars ***next*** if you buy it on the street side ***next*** i think would be two three dollars ***next*** 
it might cost you fifteen twenty dollars ***next*** if you buy it on the street side ***next*** i think would be two three dollars ***next*** you should be able to get it ***next*** 
so here is an air conditioned area ***next*** uh within a shopping mall that is next to a hotel ***next*** in the same district of bugis ***next*** and what we've done is we've conserved the old buildings ***next*** 
well there is food all around ***next*** but here it seems to be having a food fair ***next*** so that i think that was when it was photographed ***next*** but generally they have stalls selling a whole lot of things ***next*** 
you can shop in here ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** but just opposite is the lane ***next*** 
but just opposite is the lane ***next*** where you uh have shops on your left and right ***next*** and you have a whole range of items from ***next*** uh tshirts that young people like to wear ***next*** 
um i would wanna try something very different ***next*** um that is uh none western in nature ***next*** i would want it to be something that is authentic of singapore ***next*** okay ***next*** 
um that is uh none western in nature ***next*** i would want it to be something that is authentic of singapore ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** here can you see the stall here on your left ***next*** that's a peking duck right ***next*** can you see the ch~ ***next*** 
here can you see the stall here on your left ***next*** that's a peking duck right ***next*** can you see the ch~ ***next*** no that's chicken ***next*** 
can you see the ch~ ***next*** no that's chicken ***next*** very fat chicken ***next*** and right at the end of the brown bird ***next*** 
uh at these stalls you usually can get two kinds ***next*** uh roasted or you can get it a normal chicken rice ***next*** uh the chicken is boiled with pandan ***next*** do you know pandan leaves that are fragrance ***next*** 
do you know pandan leaves that are fragrance ***next*** um yes ***next*** and so uh the chicken is boiled ***next*** and then the soup that is used to boil the chicken ***next*** 
um yes ***next*** and so uh the chicken is boiled ***next*** and then the soup that is used to boil the chicken ***next*** is used to cook the rice ***next*** 
and they add a little bit of oil so the rice in itself ***next*** in fact when i was a child i used to eat a lot of just the rice ***next*** we pour thick black sauce over it ***next*** and if you like to have it hot then you take a vinegarish chili ***next*** 
so it's more of the broth of the chicken ***next*** uh that's the same thing that you use for cooking the rice is that it ***next*** uh yes ***next*** yes ***next*** 
uh that's the same thing that you use for cooking the rice is that it ***next*** uh yes ***next*** yes ***next*** and then you get a soup ***next*** 
would it be a cup of rice or is it just how ***next*** like how many servings ***next*** uh sometimes they have a fix deal ***next*** three dollars a plate ***next*** 
maybe when i get there ***next*** yes ***next*** that is something that's a favourite with locals ***next*** and with tourist as well ***next*** 
and what else would you suggest ***next*** um something else authentic ***next*** or something authentic or different ***next*** some ***next*** 
or something authentic or different ***next*** some ***next*** okay ***next*** something that's very nice uh that uh we like and tourist like ***next*** 
okay ***next*** something that's very nice uh that uh we like and tourist like ***next*** and the restaurants are ***next*** the food vendors are very good at ***next*** 
and the restaurants are ***next*** the food vendors are very good at ***next*** um sometimes you know if you tell them "i don't want it so hot" ***next*** they will make it with a little bit less chili ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and this is something that's only available in the restaurant ***next*** or do they also sell this in the side street ***next*** uh so ***next*** 
and this is something that's only available in the restaurant ***next*** or do they also sell this in the side street ***next*** uh so ***next*** usually at the restaurants ***next*** 
that's right ***next*** it's mantou that is uh usually served in chinese food ***next*** when i was young we uh just add it with plain white bread ***next*** so what ***next*** 
so the ***next*** okay ***next*** so um and the mantou is the one that they use for the dumplings right ***next*** uh yes ***next*** 
that would be your carbohydrate ***next*** the bread ***next*** okay ***next*** it's a sweet ***next*** 
the bread ***next*** okay ***next*** it's a sweet ***next*** uh not so sweet ***next*** 
okay ***next*** it's a sweet ***next*** uh not so sweet ***next*** it's chili with uh sweet sauce ***next*** 
wow ***next*** that's expensive ***next*** a whole crab yah ***next*** uh maybe thirty ***next*** 
no ***next*** uh i do it all the time ***next*** if i too expensive ***next*** i tell them " no ***next*** 
i tell them " no ***next*** uh yah ***next*** but uh as i said this dish is very nice ***next*** if you have a few people to share ***next*** 
uh yah ***next*** but uh as i said this dish is very nice ***next*** if you have a few people to share ***next*** then you order things like vegetables ***next*** 
if you have a few people to share ***next*** then you order things like vegetables ***next*** and let me see what do we have here ***next*** i can't recognise this dish ***next*** 
oh this is ***next*** clams ***next*** uh yah ***next*** clams steamed and they have mixed garlic ***next*** 
this would be much less ***next*** maybe twelve fifteen ***next*** it varies with the restaurants ***next*** uh the ***next*** 
raise prices uh for some restaurants during the lunar new year ***next*** uh but if they raise prices it would be you know on the menu ***next*** or they would be assigned to tell you ***next*** they wouldn't suddenly give you a bill you know ***next*** 
it's a nice place ***next*** um yes ***next*** um is that a river ***next*** yes ***next*** 
um yes ***next*** um is that a river ***next*** yes ***next*** that is the river which is right next to the f one uh race track ***next*** 
yes ***next*** that is the river which is right next to the f one uh race track ***next*** okay ***next*** and it opens out into the marina bay ***next*** 
and it opens out into the marina bay ***next*** which is now our reservoir ***next*** uh which collects rainwater that falls in the city ***next*** so you know the ambiance is very nice ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and that you don't have to eat the crab if you don't like ***next*** you can have steamed prawns ***next*** you can have a fish ***next*** 
or would i get a better taste of singapore ***next*** if i take my food and buy it from the street vendors ***next*** if you buy it from the street vendors ***next*** uh you are getting more singaporean taste ***next*** 
um you are getting what i would be eating without busting my budget ***next*** if you go into the restaurants ***next*** you are getting sometimes it is modified to the taste of the tourist ***next*** that means the chili maybe a little bit left out ***next*** 
if you go into the restaurants ***next*** you are getting sometimes it is modified to the taste of the tourist ***next*** that means the chili maybe a little bit left out ***next*** uh if you are buying off the street ***next*** 
you are getting sometimes it is modified to the taste of the tourist ***next*** that means the chili maybe a little bit left out ***next*** uh if you are buying off the street ***next*** you can ask them ***next*** 
that means the chili maybe a little bit left out ***next*** uh if you are buying off the street ***next*** you can ask them ***next*** you ***next*** 
when they can they will reduce it for you ***next*** but otherwise for two dollars or three dollars ***next*** they will give you what they have ***next*** and you know uh it would be maybe a little bit more adventurous ***next*** 
they're very friendly ***next*** so i eat there quite often ***next*** and you would obviously look like a tourist ***next*** so they would be happy to accommodate you ***next*** 
yes ***next*** for ***next*** uh or to shop ***next*** to spend that's a lot of money ***next*** 
okay ***next*** or even two days right ***next*** yah ***next*** no ***next*** 
that's good enough for food and then for shopping ***next*** yes for food ***next*** you can even eat your crab ***next*** uh you will still have money left over ***next*** 
and you can eat street food also ***next*** you don't want to blow it all on restaurants right ***next*** so in little india ***next*** if you eat in the little cafes ***next*** 
if you eat in the little cafes ***next*** uh it will cost you uh ten dollars if you order more than one dish ***next*** ten dollars ***next*** if you will order ***next*** 
the road is called veerasamy road ***next*** i don't think they are on the internet ***next*** but they will have different uh vegetarian ***next*** like pancakes cooked with unions uh cooked with potatoes inside ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so it's not expensive ***next*** and uh does singapore also provide or serve ethnic food ***next*** ethnic food would be the food you get in little india ***next*** 
or let's say um it's singaporean brand type of food ***next*** is there something like that ***next*** chicken rice and chili crab are very singaporean ***next*** because we uh supposed to have adopted the chicken rice from china ***next*** 
um during chinese new year we have another one ***next*** it's called yusheng that we tossup ***next*** it's a salad that we eat ***next*** and that's also singaporean ***next*** 
on let's say during september or maybe this month ***next*** no they serving that ***next*** because it's superstitious when we eat that ***next*** as we add the ingredients and we toss it up ***next*** 
uh you've got to come before the new year ***next*** because during the chinese new year ***next*** some of the restaurants maybe closed for the first day or the second day ***next*** to give their staff a break ***next*** 
to give their staff a break ***next*** and that's uh in february ***next*** uh you have to check the chinese calendar ***next*** so it changes because it's not a gregorian calendar ***next*** 
you want to ***next*** is there anything else that i can do ***next*** let's say if ***next*** you wanted to uh buy some uh computer peripherals ***next*** 
let's say if ***next*** you wanted to uh buy some uh computer peripherals ***next*** is that right ***next*** you were mentioned it just now ***next*** 
it's ***next*** yes ***next*** it's a mall ***next*** it's ***next*** 
it's a mall ***next*** it's ***next*** uh when it's open it's dedicated to computer items ***next*** information technology shops ***next***

yes so do you see boat quay ***next*** yes so do you see boat quay ***next*** it's on the opposite banks of uh the hill street area ***next*** where the road name is shown ***next*** 
okay ***next*** um is that a fiveminute or tenminute walk ***next*** if you walk fast just five minutes ***next*** otherwise if you are looking at things which i presume you will be doing ***next*** 
uh this museum shows you the early history of singapore ***next*** in the front foyer ***next*** i'm sorry ***next*** and uh ***next*** 
um it was ***next*** is that the old british office ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** that's the old british office that used to be a government office ***next*** 
um would i be allowed as a tourist to take photographs of the museum ***next*** uh not inside the exhibits there ***next*** because uh i think one is for security reasons ***next*** and sometimes people forget to switch off their flash ***next*** 
um we have an southeast asian exhibit ***next*** uh this is my favourite ***next*** it's west asia ***next*** it's a room where you find out about uh the islamic culture ***next*** 
and they have got old calligraphy ***next*** uh small little e~ ***next*** korans you know the holly book for the muslims ***next*** with hand drawn calligraphy ***next*** 
with hand drawn calligraphy ***next*** okay ***next*** if you like you can also visit this museum ***next*** the peranakan museum which is also nearby ***next*** 
and would i have to pay an entrance fee ***next*** or can i enter the museum without paying anything ***next*** uh for the asian civilisation's museum ***next*** the outside area that shows you the singapore history and the history of the river ***next*** 
or can i enter the museum without paying anything ***next*** uh for the asian civilisation's museum ***next*** the outside area that shows you the singapore history and the history of the river ***next*** that one ***next*** 
uh for the asian civilisation's museum ***next*** the outside area that shows you the singapore history and the history of the river ***next*** that one ***next*** that one is uh free of charge ***next*** 
that one is uh free of charge ***next*** so if you go too late and you think you have no time ***next*** uh then i suggest you go to visit just the outside area ***next*** and you can take photographs from there into the river ***next*** 
so you get a good view ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
can you see this picture here ***next*** um yes ***next*** uh so let me see huh ***next*** so the acm is here ***next***

so walking distance and your uh rice chicken ***next*** uh sorry your chili crab is down boat quay ***next*** just a little bit further down ***next*** let me see if i can get the prices for you ***next*** 
okay ***next*** well that's really ***next*** that's an affordable price ***next*** okay ***next*** 
that's an affordable price ***next*** okay ***next*** very affordable ***next*** and you may even get it free ***next*** 
and uh do they also sell souvenirs in the museum ***next*** yes ***next*** there is a museum shop but uh the souvenirs are very good quality ***next*** so they are not low price ***next*** 
uh and then you can buy your computer it products from funan centre ***next*** okay ***next*** sounds really good ***next*** four hundred dollars is a lot of money ***next***

what do you call that ***next*** the indian city ***next*** yes ***next*** uh the indian restaurants there um in little india ***next*** 
that one is walking distance ***next*** if you take the one ***next*** and that's a hundred and forty dollars ***next*** yes ***next*** 
and that's a hundred and forty dollars ***next*** yes ***next*** if you take the one in little india ***next*** you have to take a train ***next*** 
okay ***next*** i wouldn't mind ***next*** i definitely enjoy singapore walking ***next*** yes ***next*** 
i definitely enjoy singapore walking ***next*** yes ***next*** do you want to see a map of the uh train ***next*** the so~ ***next*** 
the so~ ***next*** um yes ***next*** i would definitely appreciate it ***next*** 'cause i think i haven't shown you that right ***next*** 
uh what is ***next*** your mrt ***next*** how does one train ride cost ***next*** it goes by distance ***next*** 
so it depends on how far you travel ***next*** and from what you have planned ***next*** it's not very far ***next*** so uh maybe the longest distance would be from the airport to the city ***next*** 
okay ***next*** hm changi ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** okay that's station number three ***next*** you take it to tanah merah ***next*** and you have to get off and switch on a train that goes westwards ***next*** 
you take it to tanah merah ***next*** and you have to get off and switch on a train that goes westwards ***next*** okay ***next*** and when you go down westwards you travel down ***next*** 
and when you go down westwards you travel down ***next*** if you are going to book into the hotel in little india ***next*** you switch ***next*** you ***next*** 
if you are going to book into the hotel in little india ***next*** you switch ***next*** you ***next*** i think you go all the way down to outram park that would be easier ***next*** 
can you see the purple line ***next*** um yes ***next*** so that's outram park very near to chinatown ***next*** you turn north east ***next*** 
there are hotels also in chinatown ***next*** but you can carry on to little india ***next*** and that's only one two three four stops ***next*** that would be maybe your most expensive ride ***next*** 
hm under three dollars singapore money ***next*** okay ***next*** that's very affordable ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yah it's the river ***next*** is that the river ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and the marina bay is also part of the racing line ***next*** yes ***next*** you see the bay ***next*** 
and the marina bay is also part of the racing line ***next*** yes ***next*** you see the bay ***next*** so when you take photographs you have the bay in your background ***next*** 
um and when you walk around you can see the marina bay sands ***next*** which is one of our two um integrated resorts ***next*** beautiful view for the background ***next*** if you uh don't want to get off at clarke quay ***next*** 
uh city hall is maybe a little bit nearer ***next*** two minutes nearer to where you would be seated for your show ***next*** for your ***next*** well i call it a show for the f one race ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and um your mrt system ***next*** is it a subway or is it an elevated type of mrt system ***next*** it's a mix ***next*** 
you get a good view until kallang yes ***next*** and then it goes underground because that area is builtup ***next*** and in the chinatown area it is all uh builtup so it is underground ***next*** but when you go out of the city it is above ground for some parts ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and this mr syste~ ***next*** mrt system that you're showing me it covers entire singapore ***next*** almost all of singapore ***next*** 
but it's also integrated with a bus system ***next*** so for example uh at paya lebar where you have an interchange ***next*** there are lots of buses there to cover areas not covered by the mrt ***next*** at dhoby ghaut there are lots of buses as well and at city hall ***next*** 
so for example uh at paya lebar where you have an interchange ***next*** there are lots of buses there to cover areas not covered by the mrt ***next*** at dhoby ghaut there are lots of buses as well and at city hall ***next*** we also have a bus information board behind ***next*** 
and so they need to provide the uh transportation ***next*** we also have a night rider system where the buses bring people from areas like ***next*** uh chinatown uh the night clubbing areas back into the major cities ***next*** this is more to service singaporeans who have a night out ***next*** 
uh that's considered an unsafe area ***next*** the ***next*** uh unsafe area ***next*** i really cannot think of any unsafe area ***next*** 
i really cannot think of any unsafe area ***next*** as long as you don't um you know wear jewelry like gold chain and gold ***next*** uh you know some people ***next*** some men like to wear gold bracelets you know ***next*** 
everything that i need for my trip this is~ ***next*** this september ***next*** okay ***next*** uh i hope you will come and remember to buy your tickets early ***next***

two to three stops through little india ***next*** where you can choose from a whole variety of indian food ***next*** well so it sounds like that uh hotel near the chinese restaurant is the winner ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** 
architectural heritage award ***next*** that sounds like a big deal ***next*** they did win an award ***next*** yes that ***next*** 
they did win an award ***next*** yes that ***next*** that means the building is a pretty building ***next*** okay ***next*** 
it's in a conservation area ***next*** and the buildings were totally renovated ***next*** so they would maybe late eighteen hundreds or early nineteen hundreds ***next*** i'm not very clear on the exact date ***next*** 
so you are in uh one of my favourite districts with all these history around you ***next*** and yet you have clean rooms ***next*** you have uh the convenience of uh shopping just outside ***next*** food ***next*** 
there is a stop on the trains ***next*** but you will have to change trains ***next*** which i think is not a problem for you ***next*** right ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** so i have to take ***next*** is it like uh subway or is it um one of those uh skyway trains ***next*** uh it is ***next*** 
alright ***next*** okay so that little uh inn is where the hotel is ***next*** yes ***next*** and there is uh two stops that will bring you near here ***next*** 
the other one is on the other side and it's called chinatown ***next*** so you can just walk to where your hotel is ***next*** it's on uh slightly quieter part of chinatown ***next*** there are other hostels in the other side lanes ***next*** 
uhhm ***next*** where we have food stalls and souvenir shops ***next*** so this is a nice lane ***next*** uh that used to be a red light district but no more ***next*** 
that i would have been worried if it was a red light district ***next*** because i bring my boyfriend ***next*** no ***next*** it' s not a red light district at all ***next*** 
so they pretty much made it uh a tourist spot or upscale place ***next*** uh not really only for tourist ***next*** for locals as well ***next*** it's just the hotels are aim at the tourist ***next*** 
uh not really only for tourist ***next*** for locals as well ***next*** it's just the hotels are aim at the tourist ***next*** uh but the food and the uh ***next*** 
they would understand english ***next*** if you speak slowly ***next*** um hm okay ***next*** and if you are negotiating prices ***next*** 
if you speak slowly ***next*** um hm okay ***next*** and if you are negotiating prices ***next*** what i do when i visit uh some other countries is that i bring a calculator ***next*** 
but ***next*** most of the shopkeepers and the people who sell things along the roadside ***next*** they understand basic english ***next*** so it should not be a problem ***next*** 
most of the shopkeepers and the people who sell things along the roadside ***next*** they understand basic english ***next*** so it should not be a problem ***next*** you may have problem understanding them ***next*** 
they understand basic english ***next*** so it should not be a problem ***next*** you may have problem understanding them ***next*** because we speak singlish ***next*** 
that's an interesting term ***next*** singlish ***next*** yes ***next*** singapore english ***next*** 
i wonder when i heard it i was thinking okay ***next*** it sounds like they're singing english ***next*** okay ***next*** no singlish uh ***next*** 
no singlish uh ***next*** that's pretty cool ***next*** the ***next*** yes uh uh ***next*** 
that's pretty cool ***next*** the ***next*** yes uh uh ***next*** uh so if you can't understand them ***next*** 
i think there was a song about that ***next*** uh with the same words ***next*** yes ***next*** we had uh singer composer who is very popular ***next*** 
uh with the same words ***next*** yes ***next*** we had uh singer composer who is very popular ***next*** who composed songs and music with using singlish ***next*** 
exactly not bad ***next*** but it's still such a short trip ***next*** so huh ***next*** yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars ***next*** 
can you tell me the difference between the two ***next*** what they offer ***next*** the reserves is the uh governing body for the bird park the zoo and the night safari ***next*** and the zoo and night safari are next to each other ***next*** 
what they offer ***next*** the reserves is the uh governing body for the bird park the zoo and the night safari ***next*** and the zoo and night safari are next to each other ***next*** so i suggest you buy a ticket for all three attractions ***next*** 
and spend a morning at the bird park and you have the afternoon free ***next*** wow ***next*** so how far is that from the hotel ***next*** uh when i get back to the screen i'll show you ***next*** 
which is part of the wildlife reserves ***next*** okay ***next*** oh sounds like an awesome place ***next*** yes ***next*** 
okay ***next*** oh sounds like an awesome place ***next*** yes ***next*** uh very good for photography ***next*** 
but ***next*** so where you saw the birds feeding just now ***next*** yes ***next*** they usually put out bird food and fruits ***next*** 
you can buy let's say of just a few dollars for the bird feed ***next*** and you can either hold it up in your little plastic container ***next*** or if you are brave you put the seed on your hand ***next*** and they will feed of your hand ***next*** 
it sounds like a great thing a package ***next*** so um like uh what are the prices for you know if it's like a whole day thing ***next*** or um do we just have to pay upon entrance and then we have to pay for other attractions within that area ***next*** yes ***next*** 
wha~ ***next*** yes ***next*** and it doesn't have any hair ***next*** so that's why they called it a nudist uh colony ***next*** 
there is a show and you can ***next*** after the show they'll bring out some of the animals ***next*** if you like to handle a snake ***next*** well that might be an opportunity for you ***next*** 
we just had a new baby born ***next*** and ***next*** that is cute ***next*** so here we have the uh ***next*** 
so if you walk fast and you are not too tired out ***next*** you can take the tram ride ***next*** and after that do the walking trail ***next*** okay just uh maybe an hour if you walk slowly ***next*** 
you can take the tram ride ***next*** and after that do the walking trail ***next*** okay just uh maybe an hour if you walk slowly ***next*** because you say you like animals ***next*** 
unless you take a break and journey to the bird park and comeback for the night safari ***next*** because at the breakfast time you have your breakfast ***next*** the orangutans have their breakfast ***next*** and then uh can go up and take photos with the orangutans ***next*** 
that would yah that sounds like a good plan ***next*** like um so we fill up the whole day and don't have to waste any of it ***next*** uh on the other hand um during the showtime also at the zoo ***next*** you can opt to buy food and feed the animals ***next*** 
where can we buy the food for the animals ***next*** eh uh in the same place ***next*** the ***next*** the keepers will be there with the food ***next*** 
the ***next*** the keepers will be there with the food ***next*** so it is actually managed by the keepers ***next*** so they want to keep it under control ***next*** 
oh yah ***next*** oh no that won't make ***next*** that we might bring in something that they shouldn't be eating ***next*** yah ***next*** 
let me show you the opening hours and the rates um ***next*** so night safari ***next*** this is the leopard cat ***next*** you are only allowed in after dark ***next*** 
yap ***next*** okay so thirtytwo singapore dollars for each person ***next*** and includes ***next*** uh just a minute ***next*** 
okay so thirtytwo singapore dollars for each person ***next*** and includes ***next*** uh just a minute ***next*** have a look at this chart here ***next*** 
you'll pay fiftyeight dollars ***next*** and that same ticket you'll visit all three attractions ***next*** normally you would have thirty days to use up the ticket ***next*** so in your two days for sure you would use it up within the thirtyday limit ***next*** 
uh do i have to use the ticket within the day itself ***next*** or can i use it on separate days ***next*** no you can use it on separate days ***next*** as long as it's within thirty days of the time you buy it ***next*** 
as long as it's within thirty days of the time you buy it ***next*** oh i see ***next*** so the first visit whether it's a bird park zoo or night safari ***next*** you can buy this ticket ***next*** 
so that's about sixty dollars or fiftyeight dollars for both of you ***next*** right ***next*** yes ***next*** so that would be a hundred and twenty dollars ***next*** 
can you show me like uh other shopping areas that are uh close ***next*** shopping areas ***next*** okay ***next*** shopping areas ***next*** 
yes ***next*** the best places to shop ***next*** okay just a moment ***next*** you have a lot of money ***next*** 
it's just ***next*** it's like a really long street right ***next*** it's a long street but it's very walkable ***next*** because uh it's now connected by underpasses ***next*** 
it's like a really long street right ***next*** it's a long street but it's very walkable ***next*** because uh it's now connected by underpasses ***next*** where we have shops even in the other pass ***next*** 
is that like a recent ***next*** so ***next*** uh no ***next*** the underpasses yes it's quite recent ***next*** 
uh no ***next*** the underpasses yes it's quite recent ***next*** and uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it ***next*** so that they can you know don't have to negotiate traffic light junctions ***next*** 
so that they can you know don't have to negotiate traffic light junctions ***next*** and it's a seamless travel from place to place ***next*** so here you're seeing some of the scenes ***next*** this is the little road off the main road ***next*** 
we have bus and eating places alfresco ***next*** behind there are also um uh restaurants in ***next*** usually besides alfresco you have also um indoor dining areas ***next*** so you can shop and eat and shop and eat ***next*** 
so i mean since i've a lot of money and lots of gifts to buy ***next*** uh speaking more of uh less upscale areas or shopping malls ***next*** yes ***next*** less upscale ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh you are in chinatown ***next*** so i suggest you shop in chinatown for your gifts ***next*** if you have to buy lots and lots of gifts ***next*** 
um hm okay ***next*** and also little india ***next*** and you can do a bit of bargaining but usually the prices are very good ***next*** just give me a moment to show you the street scene ***next*** 
just give me a moment to show you the street scene ***next*** sure ***next*** there's a lot of street side shopping in chinatown ***next*** where you can buy off the stalls uh that are in front of the shops ***next*** 
sure ***next*** there's a lot of street side shopping in chinatown ***next*** where you can buy off the stalls uh that are in front of the shops ***next*** and you can also go into the shops to buy ***next*** 
where you can buy off the stalls uh that are in front of the shops ***next*** and you can also go into the shops to buy ***next*** they are very competitive ***next*** so prices are attractive ***next*** 
they are very competitive ***next*** so prices are attractive ***next*** they would hang out signs like any three items for ten singapore dollars ***next*** or if you buy one it's two dollars ***next*** 
last time i went to bangkok ***next*** god they were telling me like if you buy at least three items in the store ***next*** you get discounts ***next*** yes ***next*** 
god they were telling me like if you buy at least three items in the store ***next*** you get discounts ***next*** yes ***next*** uh for us it's not like this ***next*** 
you get discounts ***next*** yes ***next*** uh for us it's not like this ***next*** it's not a wholesale thing ***next*** 
an offer to attract you to buy more than one item ***next*** so you get to uh ***next*** let's say a fan and uh chopsticks ***next*** it might be a mixed things or it might be just fan ***next*** 
so they don't consider themselves uh wholesale ***next*** it's just uh a gimmick ***next*** you know like the package for visiting the zoo the bird park and night safari ***next*** to encourage you to buy more ***next*** 
yap ***next*** yah ***next*** i can see how that works and attracts people ***next*** it attracts me as well ***next***

uh you will be able to see them as you walked around ***next*** and they might have offers for you ***next*** uh generally they charge about ninetyeight dollars ***next*** but sometimes they go for sixtyeight and even less than that ***next*** 
but sometimes they go for sixtyeight and even less than that ***next*** uh they give you offers ***next*** so that you will sign up as a member ***next*** but uh as a tourist maybe uh ***next*** 
oh i like those ***next*** yes so every both days you can go ***next*** yes so every both days you can go ***next*** it's not expensive ***next***

okay ***next*** uh when you come in from the airport and you at number three ***next*** and i'll come ***next*** i'll talk about the train system later ***next*** 
yes ***next*** you follow the green line ***next*** and it's easier if you could take it all the way to outram park ***next*** and then you switch to the northeast line ***next*** 
and then the purple one to chinatown ***next*** hey that's not bad ***next*** that's right ***next*** and this stop is very near to your hotel ***next*** 
and this stop is very near to your hotel ***next*** wow ***next*** wait uh do you know how many meters or how far and of a walking distance ***next*** uh well i count in time of minutes ***next*** 
not bad ***next*** okay that still pretty close ***next*** very close ***next*** uh the other way if you want to go to sentosa ***next*** 
the purple line ***next*** and you go just two stops to harbourfront ***next*** and there are two ways you can go into sentosa ***next*** you can cross the road and take a light trail ***next*** 
and you go just two stops to harbourfront ***next*** and there are two ways you can go into sentosa ***next*** you can cross the road and take a light trail ***next*** which is at the upper level of a big shopping centre ***next*** 
and there are two ways you can go into sentosa ***next*** you can cross the road and take a light trail ***next*** which is at the upper level of a big shopping centre ***next*** but it's more convenient to just take the bus shuttle in ***next*** 
so you walk from ***next*** so there's a bus going from harbourfront to sentosa ***next*** yes ***next*** you just have to walk a short distance when you come out of the train station ***next*** 
you follow the signals to say that it goes to the bus terminals ***next*** and just behind ***next*** can you see behind harbourfront here on the righthand side ***next*** it's not shown but there's a big bus terminals ***next*** 
can you see behind harbourfront here on the righthand side ***next*** it's not shown but there's a big bus terminals ***next*** and the sentosa shuttle occupies uh two bus lots ***next*** very near to the ***next*** 
uh hm that ***next*** oh when you reached the bus train in sentosa ***next*** i think the beach is quite near or you can ***next*** if the beach is not near you can just take a shuttle to near the beach ***next*** 
oh when you reached the bus train in sentosa ***next*** i think the beach is quite near or you can ***next*** if the beach is not near you can just take a shuttle to near the beach ***next*** they are internal shuttles within sentosa ***next*** 
and sentosa island ***next*** uh siloso beach ***next*** there are three beaches along sentosa ***next*** so ***next*** 
so ***next*** yah so i choose to one of them right ***next*** yes or could walk the whole distance from end to end ***next*** and have a ***next*** 
yes or could walk the whole distance from end to end ***next*** and have a ***next*** yah if i have a lot of time ***next*** when you reached sentosa ***next*** 
so can you see getting there the different coloured lines ***next*** yah ***next*** blue red and green ***next*** so uh these are the buses that fly to different areas in sentosa ***next*** 
so ***next*** that's right ***next*** and there also a beach tram that you can take ***next*** if you just want to have a fun ride on the beach tram ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so they don't have that ***next*** okay ***next*** huh ***next*** 
no not in sentosa ***next*** it's on the east coast of singapore ***next*** um i forgot the name ***next*** uh it's ***next*** 
yah let me see if i can get it on east coast parkway ***next*** okay ***next*** uh there so much to do in the singapore ***next*** this is what ***next***

uh we have a reservoir it is called the uh bedok ***next*** there you go wakeboarding ***next*** and this is a controlled environment ***next*** it's not the sea ***next*** 
uh yes i have uh of ***next*** near to changi actually ***next*** just for a second ***next*** and it was a tourist who said to me ***next*** 
"did you see the dolphin" ***next*** i said "i thought i saw a little bit but i thought it was screaming" ***next*** but he saw it ***next*** so it must have been real ***next*** 
so it must have been real ***next*** oh it's ***next*** oh so if you blink too fast you will miss it ***next*** that's right ***next*** 
uh we get turtles landing on our beach occasionally ***next*** oh i love to see that ***next*** i've never seen turtles ***next*** um you can't really see it because we find them accidentally ***next*** 
i've never seen turtles ***next*** um you can't really see it because we find them accidentally ***next*** and then what happens is the public will inform underwater world ***next*** which is on sentosa ***next*** 
and then what happens is the public will inform underwater world ***next*** which is on sentosa ***next*** it's a lovely aquarium ***next*** and ***next*** 
uh underwater world sentosa okay ***next*** so is that separate from the uh the singapore zoo that we saw earlier ***next*** the reserves ***next*** yes that is separate ***next*** 
the reserves ***next*** yes that is separate ***next*** that would be on this island called sentosa ***next*** where you go to the beach ***next*** 
so i can see where the beach is um from that map ***next*** and then ***next*** okay ***next*** can you see this ***next*** 
yap ***next*** yes ***next*** and you'll see them in ***next*** displayed in uh like an aquarium environment ***next*** 
yes ***next*** and you'll see them in ***next*** displayed in uh like an aquarium environment ***next*** but you also get underground where there is a whole aquarium around you ***next*** 
so uh th ***next*** that's a good way to put it ***next*** you will stand on the travelator ***next*** and there are signboards at the side to show you ***next*** 
that's a good way to put it ***next*** you will stand on the travelator ***next*** and there are signboards at the side to show you ***next*** you know usually what's animal ***next*** 
you can even see baby sharks that are in the process of being uh hatched you know from the eggs ***next*** wow ***next*** in the show you are seeing here ***next*** there's a dolphin interacting ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh you will just pay a little fee ***next*** and it will get a little bit wet ***next*** you don't have to go all the way in ***next*** 
i wanna try that ***next*** you have to show me the prices or rates for those ***next*** okay uh underwater world ***next*** uh this is if you dive ***next*** 
okay uh underwater world ***next*** uh this is if you dive ***next*** okay a hundred and twenty dollars if you actually bring your diving suit and dive ***next*** and if you swim a hundred and seventy ***next*** 
except see them behind glass ***next*** uh okay ***next*** uh so that's ***next*** that no ***next*** 
uh so that's ***next*** that no ***next*** it's a very safe environment here in the singapore ***next*** we don't expose tourists to any risk ***next*** 
and your boyfriend can take your photograph for you ***next*** so that's good right ***next*** yah ***next*** you have money left over ***next*** 
yah ***next*** you have money left over ***next*** if you are generous and you want the fish to uh have a nibble at your feet ***next*** can you see fish reflexology ***next***

at least i know it's not painful ***next*** oh no ***next*** it's not painful at all ***next*** and it's uh quite popular ***next*** 
oh no ***next*** it's not painful at all ***next*** and it's uh quite popular ***next*** so you sit around and you can all laughter at each other ***next*** 
so you sit around and you can all laughter at each other ***next*** uh because some fish will maybe prefer a certain foot more than the other's ***next*** so that would say a lot about that person's feet ***next*** yes uh so uh we don't have much time ***next*** 
uh because some fish will maybe prefer a certain foot more than the other's ***next*** so that would say a lot about that person's feet ***next*** yes uh so uh we don't have much time ***next*** um do you have anything else you would like to ask ***next*** 
i've pretty much seen everything i wanted to see ***next*** so yah i'm then set on you know going to singapore ***next*** uh hm that's very good ***next*** so you can um have shopping money and you can apportion some of it to uh maybe a treat for yourself ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so you're comfortable taking the trains ***next*** you take the ezlink ticket from the basement of the airport ***next*** you pay and deposit for the price you gonna spend ***next*** 
so you're comfortable taking the trains ***next*** you take the ezlink ticket from the basement of the airport ***next*** you pay and deposit for the price you gonna spend ***next*** and then you can get your refund before you leave singapore ***next***

that's the easter weekend right ***next*** um that's correct ***next*** can you give me the exact dates ***next*** of arrival and departure ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so you do~ ***next*** you would like to watch a game in process uh while you are in singapore and also visit some attractions ***next*** is that right ***next*** 
is that right ***next*** that is correct ***next*** yes ***next*** okay first uh maybe we select a hotel for you ***next*** 
okay first uh maybe we select a hotel for you ***next*** and uh i show you a map of singapore ***next*** and so you know what's the location ***next*** of uh the various places ***next*** 
so this is ***next*** this should be the primary destination right ***next*** for most tourists ***next*** yes ***next*** 
for most tourists ***next*** yes ***next*** this is um ***next*** when you come in from the airport ***next*** 
when you come in from the airport ***next*** you will land at changi airport ***next*** which is in the eastern side of singapore ***next*** you know singapore isn't very large ***next*** 
so okay ***next*** so this is a portion of the map that's interesting that is enlarged ***next*** uh do you see number three here at the righthand side ***next*** uh that's the eastern corner of singapore ***next*** 
uh that's the eastern corner of singapore ***next*** and the various colours you see are the lines for the mass rapid transit ***next*** uh so it shows you the connectivity ***next*** so from changi airport if you follow the green line down and you end at outram park ***next*** 
and the various colours you see are the lines for the mass rapid transit ***next*** uh so it shows you the connectivity ***next*** so from changi airport if you follow the green line down and you end at outram park ***next*** you can go to the harbourfront which ***next*** 
but um uh since i'm actually currently interested in sentosa ***next*** so it there a hotel nearby ***next*** uh if you stay in chinatown you can get to harbourfront and you can get to the island very quickly ***next*** the hotels on the island would be a little bit pricier ***next*** 
yah that's a good option for me ***next*** so ***next*** hm okay ***next*** so back to our map here ***next*** 
so back to our map here ***next*** uh when you land at changi airport ***next*** uh at the basement is the train line uh station ***next*** and you go and see the officer and you buy what we call an ezlink card ***next*** 
and you can get a refund on the unused portion when you leave ***next*** so this would be a very fast and inexpensive way to get into town ***next*** a lots of tourist use it ***next*** s~ ***next*** 
a lots of tourist use it ***next*** s~ ***next*** you would not be bringing a huge bag right ***next*** so uh you can ***next*** 
uh hm okay ***next*** um yes it's gonna be overnight ***next*** so just a few clothes shirts and pants ***next*** yah that's right ***next*** 
so just a few clothes shirts and pants ***next*** yah that's right ***next*** so you take the train ***next*** and the nice thing is it's above ground ***next*** 
so you take the train ***next*** and the nice thing is it's above ground ***next*** so you're getting a better view than if you are say in a taxi or you know walking ***next*** anyway you wouldn't walk to town ***next*** 
so you're getting a better view than if you are say in a taxi or you know walking ***next*** anyway you wouldn't walk to town ***next*** it's a bit far ***next*** it goes above ground right up to kallang and then it goes under ground ***next*** 
anyway you wouldn't walk to town ***next*** it's a bit far ***next*** it goes above ground right up to kallang and then it goes under ground ***next*** so this mass rapid transit is partially above ground where there are space and partially underground ***next*** 
it goes above ground right up to kallang and then it goes under ground ***next*** so this mass rapid transit is partially above ground where there are space and partially underground ***next*** so you take it down to outram park and then you can switch to the purple which is the northeast line ***next*** can you see it ***next*** 
yes ***next*** and one ***next*** i can see it ***next*** yah one stop you are in chinatown ***next*** 
no it's the same uh system ***next*** it's just another name it's uh developed ***next*** the green line was developed ***next*** first the green and the red line and this is an additional line that goes straight up northeast ***next*** 
so it makes it convenient ***next*** an~ ***next*** so you stay within the station ***next*** you're just going to another level ***next*** 
you're just going to another level ***next*** and there will be many signs marked out ***next*** there'll also be people there willing to help you ***next*** you can ask anybody around you ***next*** 
uh do they speak as good as you ***next*** oh they speak ***next*** uh depends on who speak you to ***next*** um if they cannot understand you ***next*** 
a blank look ***next*** and it could be a student from somewhere else or you know ***next*** uh someone whose not comfortable with english ***next*** but i think by the third time you ask someone should be able to ask ***next*** 
and it could be a student from somewhere else or you know ***next*** uh someone whose not comfortable with english ***next*** but i think by the third time you ask someone should be able to ask ***next*** uh answer you ***next***

otherwise i get lost ***next*** oh no ***next*** uh i am horrible with directions and i don't have a problem ***next*** you just uh make sure that you are heading northeast ***next*** 
oh no ***next*** uh i am horrible with directions and i don't have a problem ***next*** you just uh make sure that you are heading northeast ***next*** so outside the train line ***next*** 
uh i am horrible with directions and i don't have a problem ***next*** you just uh make sure that you are heading northeast ***next*** so outside the train line ***next*** there are signs to tell you which direction ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh anyway when you buy your ticket ***next*** you should be able to get a map from the airport ***next*** uh and if you need help from the officer ***next***

well uh the traditional clothes for the indians ***next*** because the indians come from the southern part of singapore ***next*** uh yes so the southern indians would be wearing um uh sari ***next*** alright with ***next*** 
alright with ***next*** it's a piece of cloth five point five metre without any zips or button ***next*** uh and it's a matter of folding the cloth ***next*** uh it can come in any kind of materials from cotton right up to silk ***next*** 
the north indian ladies they wear this uh salwar kameez ***next*** which is uh consist of a long blouse and long pants uh with a scarf ***next*** so ***next*** yes that is also a traditional kind of a costume ***next*** 
uh but ***next*** yes it is still uh a normal every day kind of a dressing for our malay la~ ***next*** uh for our indian ladies here ***next*** uh but otherwise most of the other time i would think that because of the uh western ***next*** 
yes it is still uh a normal every day kind of a dressing for our malay la~ ***next*** uh for our indian ladies here ***next*** uh but otherwise most of the other time i would think that because of the uh western ***next*** uh modern influences ***next*** 
the guys ***next*** and how about for the boys ***next*** okay ***next*** the guys will be wearing um quite similar to what the uh malay guys are wearing ***next*** 
is it possible that you can show me the image ***next*** and so that i could really get the idea of the dresses the womens are wearing ***next*** and for the boys also if that is okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
uh okay ***next*** so miss lynnette so as of the moment since i ***next*** if i'm not mistaken you are searching for sari looks right ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes the image for the sari ***next*** this is quite a modern uh ***next*** yah version of the sari ***next*** you can see now on the screen ***next*** 
and the model is very beautiful too ***next*** very colourful ***next*** yah very colourful sari ***next*** it's a piece of uh cloth like i mentioned ***next*** 
for the deepavali ***next*** uh sorry ***next*** they use that clothes for the celebration of deepavali right ***next*** uh well i wouldn't say they use these clothes ***next*** 
uh quite a lot of our indian ladies today they would still try to wear traditional clothings ***next*** especially when it comes to um uh major festivals ***next*** uh like uh for example uh the deepavali ***next*** yes they do try and wear uh this kind of uh costume ***next*** 
is ***next*** how would you describe deepavali in ***next*** like for an image something like that ***next*** well uh deepavali is actually called the festival of light ***next*** 
like for an image something like that ***next*** well uh deepavali is actually called the festival of light ***next*** it's because uh the indians in their home they would like to light this um incense ***next*** and uh a candle uh in this incense ***next*** 
and uh a candle uh in this incense ***next*** uh candle holder ***next*** in their home ***next*** and basically in short it's actually a festival to celebrate the triumph of good over evil ***next*** 
like firecrackers and stuff like that ***next*** so meaning to say they are just gonna light their houses with candle ***next*** and scented candles right ***next*** uh up to the individual whether they want to use a scented or just a normal uh kind of uh candle ***next*** 
let me see what they wear ***next*** yes ***next*** alright ***next*** uh it's quite a simple clothing ***next*** 
alright ***next*** uh it's quite a simple clothing ***next*** okay ***next*** after ***next*** 
well we can call it ***next*** for indian ***next*** special name ***next*** yah ***next*** 
kurta k u r t a ***next*** kurta ***next*** kurta ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** wow ***next*** kurta ***next*** kurta um ***next*** 
uh in just ***next*** instead for just lighting the candles for their houses ***next*** is there anything special ***next*** well uh ***next*** 
and of course they get to uh eat ***next*** like i said the families would be busy cooking ***next*** uh uh to make sure when their friends and relatives come and visit ***next*** they would have food available for them ***next*** 
like i said the families would be busy cooking ***next*** uh uh to make sure when their friends and relatives come and visit ***next*** they would have food available for them ***next*** so um they will be cooking things like curry ***next*** 
uh uh to make sure when their friends and relatives come and visit ***next*** they would have food available for them ***next*** so um they will be cooking things like curry ***next*** different kind of uh flavour of curry ***next*** 
or with um uh bread like uh chapatti ***next*** that's made from wheat flour ***next*** or roti prata ***next*** uh may~ ***next*** 
that's made from wheat flour ***next*** or roti prata ***next*** uh may~ ***next*** but it maybe a little bit difficult to make this at home ***next*** 
so they can make from coconut ***next*** uh they can make from beans yellow beans lentil ***next*** uh they can make them from uh vegetables as well as spinach ***next*** alright ***next*** 
uh they can make from beans yellow beans lentil ***next*** uh they can make them from uh vegetables as well as spinach ***next*** alright ***next*** so these are some of the dishes and food that the indians would prepare to welcome their friends and relative ***next*** 
i want to know what would be the specialty or the special food that the indian people prepare for this deepavali celebration ***next*** uh okay ***next*** i uh mentioned that actually all the time they would be eating uh a lot of this bread ***next*** like roti prata chapatti naan with curry ***next*** 
uh okay ***next*** i uh mentioned that actually all the time they would be eating uh a lot of this bread ***next*** like roti prata chapatti naan with curry ***next*** so again this is one food that they will uh be uh having that ***next***

uh not special it's the way that it's cooked ***next*** uh that is special ***next*** they put this chicken um and cook them ***next*** in uh this big uh kind of a clay pot uh ***next*** 
uh that is special ***next*** they put this chicken um and cook them ***next*** in uh this big uh kind of a clay pot uh ***next*** so that is ***next***

well yah ***next*** that sounds good ***next*** the spa you know uh in singapore ***next*** so we do have spa treatment ***next*** 
okay so ***next*** okay these are just some of the option uh that we have and ***next*** well there are nice places with very uh relaxing spa in singapore ***next*** for example you can uh do the one at raffles city ***next*** 
of because of all the travelling we'll be doing ***next*** so ***next*** yah i guess i could be planning that on the second day ***next*** okay ***next*** 
so not that she has to decide whether to marry you or not eh ***next*** okay so ***next*** yah nearby to grand park ***next*** yes grand park they do have this service as well ***next*** 
so ***next*** yah we'll be doing that ***next*** so spa first before the garden ***next*** yah ***next***

so again very relaxing ***next*** so both of you will be in a relaxed mood ***next*** um enjoy a dinner in the garden ***next*** and then go for a stroll ***next*** 
i think uh if the traders uh hotel has singapore food there ***next*** then i guess i would be taking here there instead ***next*** but unless you have any other like options for me to go to with singaporean food ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** sure ***next*** no problem ***next*** then in that case you just get out of the traders hotel ***next*** 
any place more romantic ***next*** okay ***next*** than a shopping mall ***next*** then you have to uh travel a little bit ***next*** 
okay ***next*** than a shopping mall ***next*** then you have to uh travel a little bit ***next*** alright ***next*** 
than a shopping mall ***next*** then you have to uh travel a little bit ***next*** alright ***next*** um you go this placed called dempsey ***next*** 
okay ***next*** now this is just about ***next*** it will be a little bit inconvenient ***next*** uh because there is no mrt ride that's so close to the little hill up here ***next*** 
twentyfive minutes ***next*** okay ***next*** that sounds ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay ***next*** i'm going with the singaporean food ***next*** uh a lots of option um ***next*** yes ***next*** 
chi~ ***next*** okay ***next*** so why is that ***next*** i mean sorry you will eat with your hands ***next*** 
i mean sorry you will eat with your hands ***next*** rather than eating with your spoo~ ***next*** uh fork and uh knife ***next*** s~ ***next*** 
yah ***next*** it's alright ***next*** it's perfectly fine when you eat crabs using your hands ***next*** it's acceptable uh etiquette uh out here in singapore ***next*** 
thank you ***next*** uh anyway i'm a fan of spicy foods ***next*** that really won't affect me ***next*** okay ***next*** 
uh anyway i'm a fan of spicy foods ***next*** that really won't affect me ***next*** okay ***next*** if you want something a little bit uh not so exotic ***next*** 
that sounds good ***next*** let me ***next*** let's see what that is ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay ***next*** this is chicken rice ***next*** the chili crab does look tasty you know ***next*** yes ***next*** 
this is chicken rice ***next*** the chili crab does look tasty you know ***next*** yes ***next*** the chicken rice is the rice is cooked with the chicken stock ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and uh ***next*** i'm thinking she's going to enjoy those ***next*** uh okay ***next*** 
s~ ***next*** saut~ ***next*** it's marinated meat ***next*** you can have chicken uh mutton ***next*** 
lamb ***next*** uh and of course if you buy them from the chinese store ***next*** then you'd be able to get pork satay ***next*** but if you buy them from the uh malay store owner ***next*** 
a packet uh ***next*** leaf packet alright ***next*** and this is actually almost a complete meal already ***next*** you have your meat you have your vegetables and you have rice ***next*** 
later on you're going to do a proposal ***next*** so maybe this would be a better choice ***next*** um and if you again don't want to go too far away you can just walk back on the uh one fullerton ***next*** uh just a very slow walk uh through a three miles of uh esplanade area ***next*** 
uh so since i'm unable to decide ***next*** let's say ***next*** yah ***next*** so you can walk back you know ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so you can walk back you know ***next*** remember just now you saw the bay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
and you're still walking on the bay ***next*** so it's a nice uh evening stroll out here ***next*** and again uh they are not so crowded ***next*** you can always find a spot again to do your proposal if you want to do it ***next*** 
so it's a nice uh evening stroll out here ***next*** and again uh they are not so crowded ***next*** you can always find a spot again to do your proposal if you want to do it ***next*** by the bay or go back to the botanical gardens and do your proposal out there ***next*** 
s~ ***next*** oh okay ***next*** so that's ***next*** yah it looks like porcupine right ***next*** 
so that's ***next*** yah it looks like porcupine right ***next*** yah it looks like porcupine right ***next*** there are two of them ***next*** 
there are two of them ***next*** yah ***next*** uh well the local like to call this the durian ***next*** which you have this fruit back home as well ***next*** 
one of them is a theatre and the other one is um a concert hall ***next*** so yes only singapore have these uh two uh buildings out here ***next*** so you can just do your proposal anywhere along the marina bay ***next*** and in the night time it looks really nice ***next*** 
especially if the moon is out ***next*** right ***next*** the reflection ***next*** i know there's a lightning ***next*** 
right ***next*** the reflection ***next*** i know there's a lightning ***next*** yes it's actually a nice spot as well ***next*** 
i'm still thinking about the crab ***next*** but ***next*** but at least you can always have the crab at the one fullerton ***next*** and you just take a very short uh walk along the marina bay uh along the esplanade area ***next*** 
then at night i would take her to porcupine ***next*** that sound good ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
um approximately in the midafternoon about thirtytwo degrees ***next*** thirty to thirtythree ***next*** two degrees ***next*** uh november december possibly about thirty degrees in the midafternoon ***next*** 
that sounds good ***next*** so i guess i have my first whole big plan ***next*** so what do you think should i be doing on my second day at singapore ***next*** well if she accepts your proposal then of course you can do a bit of sightseeing in singapore ***next*** 
so i guess i have my first whole big plan ***next*** so what do you think should i be doing on my second day at singapore ***next*** well if she accepts your proposal then of course you can do a bit of sightseeing in singapore ***next*** right ***next***

you will see uh this building ***next*** that actually looks like a spaceship ***next*** spaceship ***next*** it's our supreme court ***next***

it's all within the vinicity of this rectangular uh greenfield ***next*** okay ***next*** so i'm going to be able to visit all the buildings because it's closeby ***next*** yes ***next*** 
that looks big ***next*** this one ***next*** okay ***next*** this one is parliament house ***next*** 
you can ***next*** if you want to visit ***next*** yes you can do that ***next*** yah ***next*** 
that's good ***next*** yap ***next*** okay ***next*** yes i agree ***next*** 
yes ***next*** yah ***next*** so you can do a ride on this boat ***next*** we called it the singapore uh cruises ***next***

and these boats in the past used to ferry goods ***next*** but the boats are slightly smaller in the past ***next*** um and right now uh these boats are run on electricity ***next*** in the past they will run on diesel ***next*** 
um and right now uh these boats are run on electricity ***next*** in the past they will run on diesel ***next*** okay ***next*** so that is a relaxing ride on the singapore river ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** okay uh hm ***next*** so uh what would you suggest i take the boat ride during the afternoon or during the morning ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** it doesn't make a difference ***next*** i would suggest that in the morning you walk around the uh padang area ***next*** where you see all the historical buildings ***next*** 
it doesn't make a difference ***next*** i would suggest that in the morning you walk around the uh padang area ***next*** where you see all the historical buildings ***next*** now take a two hours walk at ***next*** 
or three hours walk you know if some of the buildings you may want to go inside ***next*** and in the af~ ***next*** uh have uh a break for lunch in the surrounding area ***next*** either you uh break at the raffles place ***next***

alright ***next*** the first night you are on the edge of the marina ***next*** uh of the merlion ***next*** now if you take this boat you are looking at the merlion from the waters ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so after your boat cruise uh what you could do is you bring her back to the ***next*** again if you don't want to go too far away from where you are ***next*** you could just do a very small area ***next*** 
alright ***next*** so raffles city uh they are like five ***next*** four lev~ ***next*** uh five level two basement area ***next*** 
four lev~ ***next*** uh five level two basement area ***next*** uh where she can do her shopping ***next*** branded stuff midrange ***next*** 
uh where she can do her shopping ***next*** branded stuff midrange ***next*** and if that is not enough still she can go to the underground ***next*** and do uh some serious shopping again ***next***

so you must remember to buy her a big diamond ring then ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** 
at ***next*** i guess since we're going to be walking around a lot ***next*** i guess we could have it in a restaurant ***next*** okay ***next*** 
prawn mee recipe ***next*** okay ***next*** so those are fried noodles ***next*** yah ***next*** 
so those are fried noodles ***next*** yah ***next*** okay ***next*** so this is the uh something which is quite unique uh in singapore ***next*** 
yes ***next*** and some of the store do serve them with a piece of banana uh leaf at the bottom ***next*** and then you can see there's a lime for you to make the dish a little bit sour ***next*** of course the chili will be a little hot ***next*** 
okay ***next*** hokkien mee ***next*** yah ***next*** alright ***next*** 
night safari ***next*** okay ***next*** that sounds good ***next*** yah ***next***

uh yes ***next*** it's quite a big park ***next*** um and what you will do is you would go on the tram ride ***next*** if you see this uh picture over here on the lefthand side ***next*** 
now this is a tram ride ***next*** so you get onto this tram ***next*** the whole ride without stopping will take you about forty minutes ***next*** but if you make a stop midway and you walked uh the leopard's trail ***next*** 
so you get onto this tram ***next*** the whole ride without stopping will take you about forty minutes ***next*** but if you make a stop midway and you walked uh the leopard's trail ***next*** uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail ***next*** 
but if you make a stop midway and you walked uh the leopard's trail ***next*** uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail ***next*** and when you finished the trail you come back to the tram station ***next*** and you board the next tram back to the entrance ***next*** 
yes ***next*** you would actually need more time here ***next*** but uh if you have just two days um ***next*** yes this is uh maybe something that i would be able to recommend you ***next*** 
since uh you're female and all ***next*** i'm hoping that all these places are uh ***next*** i guess i should call it close to your heart ***next*** um yes i think uh based ***next*** 
um yes i think uh based ***next*** like i said on what your uh ***next*** well your coming here of course the highlight ***next*** most important one would be your proposal ***next*** 
a little bit of sightseeing ***next*** a little bit of relaxation ***next*** and not just hopping from place to another ***next*** and i think this would be ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and i'm just really hoping she remembers that i am going to propose to her ***next*** well after a nice holiday ***next*** i'm sure she will remember ***next*** 
and after all these uh walks on the second day ***next*** what do you think would be the best place or where do you think would be the best place to relax ***next*** well okay after the uh ***next*** if you two decide to exit from the park ***next*** 
uh hm okay ***next*** okay ***next*** and uh you will soak your feet in this pool ***next*** uh and these fishes will come and nibble at your feet ***next*** 
the night safari park ***next*** okay ***next*** so i guess that would complete our uh visit to singapore ***next*** yes ***next***

okay ***next*** wow ***next*** it's good enough ***next*** yah uh relax ***next***

alright um ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** bye ***next*** 
who is calling please ***next*** hi jeanne my name is june ***next*** um and i'm parti~ ***next*** june ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh what sort of uh hotel are you looking at ***next*** um you mean um hotel categories ***next*** yes that's right uh ***next*** 
it will be our first time ***next*** but if you could work on the budget that we have that would be great ***next*** and that is ***next*** what is your budget ***next*** 
uh this is more personal ***next*** i see jeanne ***next*** now my concern is how far would that be from the airport ***next*** uh not very far ***next*** 
i see jeanne ***next*** now my concern is how far would that be from the airport ***next*** uh not very far ***next*** shall i show you the airport map first then ***next*** 
uh not very far ***next*** shall i show you the airport map first then ***next*** sure ***next*** okay ***next*** 
or um where will ***next*** we take a subway ***next*** it's easier ***next*** uh actually it's a ***next*** 
and that is the eastwest line ***next*** okay ***next*** uh chinatown is on the purple line ***next*** can you see it ***next*** 
purple line ***next*** ah okay ***next*** yes uh ***next*** where you see number six and go you up to outram park and then you go down to chinatown one more stop ***next*** 
yes uh ***next*** where you see number six and go you up to outram park and then you go down to chinatown one more stop ***next*** and that is chinatown ***next*** so if you take uh the subway ***next*** 
on the green line ***next*** yes i'm seeing it right now ***next*** there's a ***next*** so after you pass there uh you would go from kallang down towards the purple line ***next*** 
you mean to say that um i need to take the eastwest line until the kallang ***next*** and then dropoff there and ride another railway ***next*** no ***next*** uh i'm just saying that up to kallang you can see ***next*** 
and then dropoff there and ride another railway ***next*** no ***next*** uh i'm just saying that up to kallang you can see ***next*** it's up above ground ***next*** 
you can see the area ***next*** and then the ground it goes underground uh and so chinatown area is busy ***next*** so all that is underground and also up to chinatown ***next*** so when you switch you just get off your train ***next***

it doesn't ***next*** yah ***next*** sorry ***next*** it doesn't say here ***next*** 
i just go to that website ***next*** yes you go that website ***next*** uh it's by the river and it's not so near to chinatown then ***next*** you have to travel by bus into chinatown ***next*** 
it's an older version of a hotel ***next*** well i've seen that um next to chinatown will be clarke quay ***next*** is that somewhere in north clarke quay ***next*** uh yes it is ***next*** 
well i've seen that um next to chinatown will be clarke quay ***next*** is that somewhere in north clarke quay ***next*** uh yes it is ***next*** you have to walk to clarke quay from here ***next*** 
but it's within walking distance ***next*** ah okay ***next*** walking distance from clarke quay okay ***next*** yes walking distance to clarke quay ***next*** 
ah okay ***next*** walking distance from clarke quay okay ***next*** yes walking distance to clarke quay ***next*** there is another hotel by the river if you want to be on the riverfront ***next*** 
walking distance from clarke quay okay ***next*** yes walking distance to clarke quay ***next*** there is another hotel by the river if you want to be on the riverfront ***next*** is called the gallery hotel ***next*** 
this is also in the city ***next*** is just uh not as convenient as the previous hotel that i showed you ***next*** because the chinatown stop on the subways ***next*** stops exactly there ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so which stop from the railways ***next*** which railway station shall i shop in order for me to get a bus ***next*** you just stop at the city centre and then you get out and you take one bus number one nine five ***next*** 
um what's the name of the um station at the city centre ***next*** the station is city hall ***next*** it's a major station and it's in a business district ***next*** so you don't even need to take that train if you outside your hotel if you take the buses ***next*** 
that's not difficult because it will stop you right in front of your hotel ***next*** uh does this hotel have a golf course maybe ***next*** no we don't have the size ***next*** uh our golf courses are separates uh usually ***next*** 
oh it's separate ***next*** ah yes ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
you know the old type of microphone ***next*** ah oh yah ***next*** okay ***next*** so you know it as the durian also huh ***next*** 
uh because ***next*** okay so the ***next*** i can actually go inside right ***next*** yes you can go inside ***next*** 
yes you can go inside ***next*** and uh we sometimes do have lunchtime concerts ***next*** uh but that would depend on um the esplanade's uh schedule ***next*** it's about only forty five minutes or one hour during lunchtime ***next*** 
it's about only forty five minutes or one hour during lunchtime ***next*** it's to encourage locals to step into our concert hall ***next*** so that you know later on they would buy the concert tickets ***next*** and attend that concerts ***next*** 
so ***next*** i see ***next*** um jeanne um how long do you think uh would be enough for us to stay inside ***next*** uh well it depends on what you are interested in ***next*** 
and places where you can have a drink or a meal ***next*** but if you don't do all that ***next*** you just take a look and then you walk along the outside ***next*** you can see by the ri~ ***next*** 
but if you don't do all that ***next*** you just take a look and then you walk along the outside ***next*** you can see by the ri~ ***next*** uh by the theatre you can reach the marina bay ***next*** 
you can see by the ri~ ***next*** uh by the theatre you can reach the marina bay ***next*** so maybe ten fifteen minutes inside and outside to photograph it ***next*** and then you walk to merlion ***next*** 
so that's nine fifteen ***next*** we're gonna be there until eleven perhaps ***next*** yes you take your photographs you walk slowly and have a look ***next*** soak in the atmosphere ***next*** 
right ***next*** okay so picture taki~ ***next*** what else can we do at the merlion park ***next*** from the merlion park ***next***

i suggest you get across to uh boat quay and clarke quay ***next*** what can we do there ***next*** uh see here you are at the bay in front of the river ***next*** uh later you uh walk along the singapore river itself ***next*** 
you can walk all the way home to your hotel ***next*** well i can deal with that ***next*** i don't think my husband will be very happy about that ***next*** well he can play golf you know ***next***

so you just tap it at the sensor when you are entering the stations ***next*** and tap it at uh when you come out the gate will open when you are on the subway ***next*** and if you are in the bus you must remember to tap it when you get off the bus ***next*** because otherwise uh the system will assume that you've taken the journey right up to the end ***next*** 
okay huh ***next*** so that is very easy uh and you can get the cards ***next*** uh well for me at the airport for you is the most convenient ***next*** but if uh you suddenly travel all over singapore ***next*** 
go back to the officer and get your refund uh before you leave ***next*** so you don't have to worry about it ***next*** uh you can also use the card for sightseeing ***next*** i did it once with a friend ***next*** 
so you don't have to worry about it ***next*** uh you can also use the card for sightseeing ***next*** i did it once with a friend ***next*** i use the trains to go all around singapore uh and once we're out of the city it is above ground ***next*** 
uh you can also use the card for sightseeing ***next*** i did it once with a friend ***next*** i use the trains to go all around singapore uh and once we're out of the city it is above ground ***next*** so you can see all around you ***next*** 
yah ***next*** um so where do you want to live in singapore ***next*** where do you want to stay ***next*** uh so you want a beach hotel or you want to stay in an ethnic area ***next*** 
you can from there to other places ***next*** one is chinatown and one is little in~ ***next*** oh okay ***next*** so in chinatown you get more uh chinese food souvenirs ***next*** 
because we are multicultural and multireligious ***next*** also in chinatown at the heart of chinatown in fact it's one of older hindu temples ***next*** which is also a national monument ***next*** and our oldest chinese temple is there and it's all within walking distance ***next*** 
when i speaking about hotels ***next*** okay where price is concerned uh little india and chinatown has uh lower priced hotels ***next*** because in their locations the rents are lower than in the island ***next*** uh so on the island i think about two hundred dollars ***next*** 
okay where price is concerned uh little india and chinatown has uh lower priced hotels ***next*** because in their locations the rents are lower than in the island ***next*** uh so on the island i think about two hundred dollars ***next*** you should be able to get a hotel a decent size hotel ***next*** 
uh so on the island i think about two hundred dollars ***next*** you should be able to get a hotel a decent size hotel ***next*** which is also a good rate ***next*** in chinatown well you don't want a dormitory do you ***next*** 
where you share the bed with other people ***next*** oh no ***next*** yah so if you want to have a room to yourself ***next*** about eighty to a hundred sixty uh you should be able to get a decent size uh room in chinatown ***next*** 
uh meals it depends on the hotel ***next*** some of them do not provide meals because all around where the hotel is there are food outlets ***next*** so sometimes it not worth the while to provide the meal ***next*** so it actually depends on the individual hotel ***next*** 
so uh i'm more familiar with chinese food than indian food ***next*** so ***next*** yah indian food the only problem is if you take too much chili ***next*** and some people can find it too hot on the tongue ***next*** 
alright ***next*** chinatown is busy day and night but they have other uh ***next*** they have hotels along the small streets they have hotels along the main road ***next*** so i can tell you from the location whether it's a quieter part of chinatown or not ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh if you're thinking of regular size hotels ***next*** you know the normal idea of hotel ***next*** it would be furama city centre ***next*** 
santa grand hundred and forty eight ***next*** and santa grand has two hotels one they call it chinatown hundred and forty eight ***next*** and lai chun yuen which is hundred and forty five ***next*** so it's about same price ***next*** 
yes ***next*** lai chun yuen is uh closer right into the heart of chinatown ***next*** even better we have this one along the side street the inn at temple street ***next*** can you see it ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh that's only one eight ***next*** and below a hundred keong saik hotel ***next*** it takes his name from the road ***next*** 
on the quieter side also at the bottom we have scarlet hotel but you can see the price it's two six five ***next*** it is a ***next*** it's luxury class ***next*** yes it's luxury class yah ***next*** 
yes it's luxury class yah ***next*** so uh porcelain hotel is on the main road ***next*** so uh maybe a little bit busier when you come out ***next*** so it's your choice whether you want to be just off the main street or you would like to be in the ***next*** 
off the main road is also maybe three four minutes away ***next*** uh i prefer the off the main road ***next*** off the main road ***next*** okay let's have a look again ***next*** 
uh start to shop downstairs and live upstairs ***next*** uh we also have a new majestic that's three hundred so we forget about that right ***next*** yes ***next*** uh we have ***next*** 
let me see ***next*** is it the same set of prices ***next*** uh it would goes up a little bit in april huh ***next*** uh thirty first of march the price is one eight ***next*** 
one hundred thirty yah this one ***next*** yah one hundred so about twelve dollars more ***next*** um that's okay ***next*** uh that's okay ***next*** 
but uh there is no breakfast you ha~ ***next*** eh it's not a problem with breakfast because you can always uh just walk out as i said ***next*** and you can have breakfast over there ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes all the hotels along this little streets are converted shop houses ***next*** uh and well this may not be a shop house itself it could be a clubhouse or whatever ***next*** but uh for the majority of the hotels they are made up of buildings ***next*** where peopl used to live upstairs and they run a business downstairs ***next*** 
yes ***next*** so it is cooked and it's stirred constantly and in the old days this was done by hand ***next*** i don't know even now whether they have a machine to do it ***next*** you can see it there uh a shop that is very well known called yakun to ***next*** 
uh can you see here spread the word ***next*** so they have made the recipe out of uh coconut milk sugar eggs and pandan ***next*** sugar eggs fragrant panda um hm ***next*** so it's natural no artificial colouring or flavouring ***next*** 
the flavour is from the leaves ***next*** and yakun is one of the most places ***next*** in fact i just had uh their breakfast this morning ***next*** and here it's like a little café ***next*** 
and yakun is one of the most places ***next*** in fact i just had uh their breakfast this morning ***next*** and here it's like a little café ***next*** nothing fancy but very affordable ***next*** 
nothing fancy but very affordable ***next*** so you can put kaya on it or you can just put butter ***next*** and we also like sugar on the toast ***next*** or cheese ***next*** 
so instead of ham and eggs or bacon and eggs ***next*** i think this is more traditional for us and maybe you want to try it ***next*** um hm you're making me hungry now actually ***next*** yah lucky i had lunch ***next*** 
i think this is more traditional for us and maybe you want to try it ***next*** um hm you're making me hungry now actually ***next*** yah lucky i had lunch ***next*** uh here the bottom and they do it perfectly ***next*** 
yes ***next*** yes ***next*** uh i like to swallow the yolk whole and that's yes ***next*** so i eat the whites and then i swallow the whole yolk it's very yummy ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh i like to swallow the yolk whole and that's yes ***next*** so i eat the whites and then i swallow the whole yolk it's very yummy ***next*** but ***next*** 
careful on that though ***next*** oh yes well i don't eat that everyday uh just a treat once in a while ***next*** and uh you ***next*** so to finish up you can have the kaya on toast ***next*** 
so you have the savoury eggs and then you have the sweet toast ***next*** and there's ice cream toast ***next*** yes ice cream toast ***next*** uh that would be maybe in the afternoon ***next*** 
no you ***next*** yah ***next*** just two days you know uh ***next*** uh yakun outlets are all over singapore and you can find them in shopping centres ***next*** 
uh yakun outlets are all over singapore and you can find them in shopping centres ***next*** you can find them along the roadsides you know where you're shopping ***next*** uh because it's a chain ***next*** the family has uh opened up many outlets all over ***next*** 
no um the other i think the beachfront hotel ***next*** hotels are ***next*** okay the beach one ***next*** alright the sentosa hotels ***next*** 
alright the sentosa hotels ***next*** okay ***next*** sentosa has uh one hotel that is not very expensive on the island ***next*** and they also have resorts style very classy hotels ***next*** 
okay ***next*** sentosa has uh one hotel that is not very expensive on the island ***next*** and they also have resorts style very classy hotels ***next*** so there is a choice ***next*** 
sentosa has uh one hotel that is not very expensive on the island ***next*** and they also have resorts style very classy hotels ***next*** so there is a choice ***next*** in singapore we have lots of choices ***next*** 
and they also have resorts style very classy hotels ***next*** so there is a choice ***next*** in singapore we have lots of choices ***next*** so you can always budget accordingly ***next*** 
so it's on a popular beach with many attractions ***next*** and here we have costa sands ***next*** wait ***next*** you're having a view of the place ***next*** 
fifteen ***next*** so let me try and find it for you ***next*** okay ***next*** the two hundred over dollars a night would be i think a hotel room ***next*** 
and there can you see it here uh ***next*** they have another hotel elsewhere ***next*** so we have to make sure that we put you on sentosa island ***next*** so you said april do you have a date for april ***next*** 
if it's two nights you'll stay till the third is that right ***next*** or do you want to go another day in april ***next*** how about april seventh ***next*** which da~ ***next*** 
so it's a weekend also ***next*** april seventh and departing on the ninth is that right ***next*** right ***next*** so it's saturday till monday ***next*** 
no room ***next*** to bad ***next*** to ba~ ***next*** if you pick uh a weekday i think you'll definitely get a room ***next*** 
april five that's a thursday ***next*** april five yes ***next*** five in ***next*** and the seventh out okay ***next*** 
and the seventh out okay ***next*** five to seven ***next*** oh no ***next*** okay ***next*** 
what's a kampong hut ***next*** uh kampong hut is a small structure it supposed to uh resemble the ***next*** uh but you see the deluxe room that's a deluxe room that you are seeing over there ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so that is the difference ***next*** some people prefer that uh they go to the uh kampong hut ***next*** because of the nostalgic uh feelings that it gives them ***next*** 
because of the nostalgic uh feelings that it gives them ***next*** but is it airconditioned ***next*** no ***next*** uh you have a look at it the rooms have definitely airconditioned ***next*** 
no ***next*** uh you have a look at it the rooms have definitely airconditioned ***next*** for the uh one that's a hundred and eighty nine dollars ***next*** kampong hut forty nine dollars i'm not sure ***next*** 
kampong hut forty nine dollars i'm not sure ***next*** uh let's see okay ***next*** because forty nine dollars uh is a little too attractive let say for a beachfront ***next*** and also some people uh they like to have the sea breezes ***next*** 
they didn't mention air conditioning ***next*** it seems like it may be ***next*** i'll try and find out for you ***next*** i don't know why it doesn't say whether it's airconditioned or not ***next*** 
uh no ***next*** i think two people if you're not gonna spend a lot of time in the room it should not be a problem ***next*** okay it's airconditioned ***next*** uh you get ***next*** 
okay it's airconditioned ***next*** uh you get ***next*** what you get are two doubledecker beds ***next*** uh and you also ***next*** 
what you get are two doubledecker beds ***next*** uh and you also ***next*** okay the only difference and this is the catch you ***next*** there's a common toilet and shower facilities nearby ***next*** 
there's a common toilet and shower facilities nearby ***next*** oh so it's ***next*** we have to share ***next*** so you'll ***next*** 
yes you have to share ***next*** so in fact the room isn't that small because you can have two doubledecker beds ***next*** and that means if you came with three other friends ***next*** you'll still be able to stay there ***next*** 
so some people on tight budget that's what they'll do ***next*** they save their money for shopping or eating ***next*** but the only problem is we have to share the comfort rooms ***next*** yes that is right ***next*** 
but the only problem is we have to share the comfort rooms ***next*** yes that is right ***next*** that's why you know the price is so low ***next*** it is even under fifty dollars ***next*** 
so here you see the hotel ***next*** so there's the neighbouring carts ***next*** okay so the deluxe room ***next*** uh let's have a look at the rates for the deluxe room ***next*** 
okay so the deluxe room ***next*** uh let's have a look at the rates for the deluxe room ***next*** uh the deluxe room then would give you more space uh more uh comfort level ***next*** and you also feel more like a tourist okay ***next*** 
uh let's have a look at the rates for the deluxe room ***next*** uh the deluxe room then would give you more space uh more uh comfort level ***next*** and you also feel more like a tourist okay ***next*** we have to find out if it's available ***next*** 
yes eleventh thirteenth ***next*** eleventh to thirteenth ***next*** okay here you are it's a hundred and eighty nine dollars ***next*** so that would be the standard deluxe ***next*** 
so that would be the standard deluxe ***next*** that's okay ***next*** uh that's okay ***next*** so i can see you like some luxury ***next*** 
and so then you'll be on the beachfronts and there are forest walks that you can do there okay ***next*** so we forget about little india and chinatown ***next*** yes ***next*** so what about sightseeing what are your preferences ***next*** 
uh are there botanical gardens in singapore ***next*** oh yes uh we have a botanic gardens that is very wellknown ***next*** and sentosa also has greenery all around ***next*** uh i'll get you the information on the botanic gardens ***next***

very comfortable forest because you can walk on a pathway and uh you see ***next*** huge trees over a hundred and fifty years old right next to you ***next*** but uh you don't have to step on mud ***next*** so it's quite comfortable ***next***

how much do i save if in case we book a little bit earlier just like re~ ***next*** maybe right now if we can book them so that we can uh maybe save something um ***next*** uh as compared to uh booking them right before the race weekend ***next*** uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it's near impossible ***next*** 
i mean how are you travelling ***next*** are you with a friend or are you coming alone ***next*** uh i'll just be alone uh for the travel ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so it's just one single room huh ***next*** yup ***next*** uh it's actually the same price if you see here ***next*** 
uh it's actually the same price if you see here ***next*** because they are not supplying a breakfast ***next*** yup ***next*** so let see if uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds ***next*** 
because they are not supplying a breakfast ***next*** yup ***next*** so let see if uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yup ***next*** so let see if uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds ***next*** okay ***next*** september ***next*** 
i think that's gonna be on the twenty first early uh part of the day ***next*** like um around eight o'clock in the morning ***next*** uh yes that's ideal ***next*** yes ***next*** 
alright that's correct ***next*** because that would be after the race ***next*** okay 2012 ***next*** and you only want one room right ***next*** 
and you only want one room right ***next*** right ***next*** okay ***next*** so let's have a look ***next*** 
we have to wait for the response and see if they have rooms or uh what sort of price ***next*** they have put there normally that's uh you know ***next*** it's a hundred and thirty dollars if you book now ***next*** so uh ***next*** 
that would be perfect ***next*** um and there are a lot of uh places where uh we can uh get something to eat um ***next*** like almost uh twenty four hours uh a day right ***next*** yes ***next*** 
and uh there you can get uh local food ***next*** uh i'm not sure if i can get you ***next*** uh whether they have uh a website ***next*** because this ***next*** 
uh whether they have uh a website ***next*** because this ***next*** it's what we used to call a hawker centre but we don't have hawker centre ***next*** uh so it's called a food centre ***next*** 
ah yah ***next*** perfect ***next*** um hm yah ***next*** okay ***next***

so i'm not sure that you can get uh sort of like imitation of the real stuff ***next*** you won't be able to get it ***next*** i don't think so ***next*** uh the market i'm talking about it doesn't have uh a website ***next*** 
yah that will be perfect ***next*** so that i can uh easily locate it ***next*** yes ***next*** uh let me see beach road ***next*** 
so that i can uh easily locate it ***next*** yes ***next*** uh let me see beach road ***next*** um hm let me see ***next*** 
the small blue ones ***next*** no i think they are attractions ***next*** they are places ***next*** i don't see the key here ***next***

and you eat it with rice ***next*** that has been cooked and ***next*** traditionally they used leaves to weave a little basket to cook it ***next*** but sometimes they put it in a tube ***next*** 
that has been cooked and ***next*** traditionally they used leaves to weave a little basket to cook it ***next*** but sometimes they put it in a tube ***next*** and then it comes out sort of circular form and it sliced up ***next*** 
but sometimes they put it in a tube ***next*** and then it comes out sort of circular form and it sliced up ***next*** now you also get uh ***next*** sorry you were gonna say ***next*** 
no nothing ***next*** i ***next*** um i like what i'm seeing ***next*** yah ***next*** 
so if ***next*** since you are travelling alone you are not gonna offend anybody ***next*** that's not very sweet okay ***next*** so ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh because the flyer is located uh within view of the race track ***next*** and uh the flyer is uh very slow moving ***next*** so you get uh time to soak in the view ***next*** 
and uh the flyer is uh very slow moving ***next*** so you get uh time to soak in the view ***next*** not only the race track but the surrounding area ***next*** if i am uh not mistaken it is only twenty nine dollars ***next*** 
not only the race track but the surrounding area ***next*** if i am uh not mistaken it is only twenty nine dollars ***next*** wow okay ***next*** yes ***next*** 
okay cool ***next*** so can you see it here ***next*** yup ***next*** and the race track is just nearby ***next***

i don't really mind walking ***next*** that's ***next*** that would be perfect ***next*** i'm a walking sort of tourist okay ***next*** 
that's ***next*** that would be perfect ***next*** i'm a walking sort of tourist okay ***next*** gonna show you the flyer now ***next*** 
yah ***next*** oh okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so you're seeing just a little bit of it at the corner there ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so you're seeing just a little bit of it at the corner there ***next*** uh this advertisement they are trying to encourage you ***next*** to uh take in a tour ***next*** 
the butler ***next*** of course this one is uh not so cheap huh ***next*** fifteen dollars if you can prove you're a student ***next*** but uh i don't think you're a student right ***next*** 
no ***next*** not anymore ***next*** uh not anymore ***next*** so marlowe i'm afraid you have to pay uh twenty nine dollars uh ***next*** 
i think that would be worth it yah ***next*** you have ***next*** uh singapore sling is a cocktail that was concocted at the raffles hotel ***next*** it's got gin angostura bitters and ***next*** 
hm okay ***next*** uh i'd like to taste the sling ***next*** yah so i think ***next*** yah so you just be prepared to pay a little bit more ***next*** 
you are given the cocktail ***next*** but it is not the singapore sling it's their own ***next*** i think they have created something else green in colour ***next*** because the uh singapore sling is pinkish red in colour ***next*** 
because the uh singapore sling is pinkish red in colour ***next*** i see ***next*** yah ***next*** so you're looking at the capsule now ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so you're looking at the capsule now ***next*** uh so this is uh how it looks like inside huh ***next*** yes that's right ***next***

yah um somewhere near um or ***next*** uh somewhere i can get some drinks maybe ***next*** um just to cap the night off after ***next*** oh then i recommend the raffles hotel ***next*** 
and ***next*** uh okay ***next*** oh really ***next*** so ***next***

uh and we have there a place called the long bar ***next*** oh okay ***next*** where the reception of the hotel is now ***next*** uh it's all been changed but the long bar used to be right at the front of the hotel ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** where the reception of the hotel is now ***next*** uh it's all been changed but the long bar used to be right at the front of the hotel ***next*** and it was the longest bar in the whole world at one time ***next*** 
so ***next*** by their bartender ***next*** so that's uh where i can get that uh famous sling huh ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** 
by their bartender ***next*** so that's uh where i can get that uh famous sling huh ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** so you're getting it uh from the place itself ***next*** 
okay cool ***next*** go ***next*** it's in the north of singapore ***next*** and where the race is held is in the south of singapore ***next*** 
it's in the north of singapore ***next*** and where the race is held is in the south of singapore ***next*** but you can connect uh to the nearest big town ***next*** and there you take a bus that will bring you directly to the zoo ***next*** 
where the few stops along uh housing areas ***next*** so it's also a good opportunity for you to see the type of housing singaporeans live in ***next*** the scenery of you know the natural neighbourhoods that you see ***next*** you will not be in the business area when you take this bus ***next*** 
cool ***next*** 'cause the zoo is where not many people live ***next*** it is in uh a reserve that is uh ***next*** to help us to collect rain water ***next*** 
'cause the zoo is where not many people live ***next*** it is in uh a reserve that is uh ***next*** to help us to collect rain water ***next*** it's next to a reservoir and that's why it is so attractive ***next*** 
um i saw something there like a night safari ***next*** is that um ***next*** yes there is also a night safari ***next*** uh but you will be watching your show right ***next*** 
so i think ah i'll watch the race first ***next*** oh yah ***next*** watch the race and either you extend the date ***next*** or you come back another time for it ***next*** 
so we've got wallabies there ***next*** we'll go through quickly so i can tell you about the uh the card that you asked me about ***next*** cat country ***next*** don't they look loveable ***next***

uh the show is not doing tricks it's just ***next*** uh the show is not doing tricks it's just ***next*** naturally they heave heavy logs in some countries ***next*** so they are like work elephants ***next*** 
i'd like that ***next*** uh i think i'll bring um my camera with a large memory ***next*** for this one for this trip ***next*** yes a very large memory ***next***

oh okay ***next*** oh really ***next*** yah it's quite exciting ***next*** because uh you know it's so near but you are protected by the glass ***next*** 
uh so the zoo is precautious ***next*** it will not uh take any risk with anybody ***next*** okay ***next*** orangutans in the wild if you see them also ***next***

i like this picture ***next*** i hope i can take some uh picture like this ***next*** sure ***next*** uh you will be able to because in the primate kingdom again it's open ***next*** 
but uh the animals are in separate islands so that the species do not mix ***next*** and they have uh water mode ***next*** is that little islands within an area ***next*** and they have trees where they can climb up and down ***next*** 
so over the years they have decided that well this is my house ***next*** and i'm happy i won't leave it ***next*** because they have uh free lodging free medical facilities ***next*** uh the only thing is they don't know how to smile at you ***next*** 
yes ***next*** the only thing is don't be enthusiastic and jump over if you are a long jumper ***next*** uh you shouldn't be able to get through uh ***next*** because if you enter any of these uh areas then the animals are likely to be defensive ***next*** 
i won't ***next*** i won't don't worry ***next*** i just want to take pictures ***next*** uh okay ***next*** 
uh okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so if you go you must take picture of this one ***next*** it's a proboscis monkey ***next***

the yellow ones are more often in india ***next*** yes ***next*** uh and one day they found one that was white ***next*** uh he had gene mutation ***next***

yah i'd like visit uh that place ***next*** so you take a bus uh from near your hotel ***next*** and i think if you ask the hotel concierge they'll be able to tell you where the ***next*** in fact i can tell you ***next*** 
can you see on the map here ***next*** okay ***next*** yup uh hm ***next*** so harbourfront here ***next*** 
um okay ***next*** perfect nice ***next*** i like that ***next*** you don't have to take the sentosa bus that will cost you an extra dollar ***next***

uh so uh ***next*** it's also ancient egypt mummies and obelisk ***next*** so you are transported back uh eighty years to the nineteen thirties ***next*** to the golden age of egyptian exploration ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** hm okay ***next*** uh here uh you can face the wrath of the mummy ***next*** on the world's first psychological thrill ride ***next***

um let me see ***next*** um any place where i can maybe get some exercise ***next*** um maybe play some football ***next*** hm playing football you have to hook up with uh the local teams ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so uh offhand now i would not be able to tell you ***next*** but uh if you asked your travel agents uh and ***next*** 
but if you're talking about information technology ***next*** uh there is a centre in singapore where you have uh a lots of these shops ***next*** so it would be easier for you to pick and choose down there ***next*** and it is called funan centre ***next*** 
so let me show you funan centre ***next*** people get it products peripherals ***next*** yah that would be perfect ***next*** i like that that's where uh singaporeans go ***next***

uh let me see if i can get the map here ***next*** oh okay ***next*** okay this is a picture of the store ***next*** uh we have buses and we have uh ***next*** 
that's why i say it's in fact walkable ***next*** uh because then you can take in the sights along the way ***next*** uh you can see uh the saint andrew's cathedral ***next*** which is uh historic monuments ***next*** 
uh because then you can take in the sights along the way ***next*** uh you can see uh the saint andrew's cathedral ***next*** which is uh historic monuments ***next*** and uh nearby uh if you divert a little bit ***next*** 
which is uh historic monuments ***next*** and uh nearby uh if you divert a little bit ***next*** it's the first church built in singapore that's still is uh more or less in its original form with addons ***next*** it's called the armenian church ***next*** 
so in the day before the race you have lots of things to occupy you yah ***next*** yah ***next*** yah i know ***next*** um hm ***next*** 
what are the other attractions that you would recommend ***next*** uh i think if you are in this area and you're willing to walk ***next*** you will be able to see attractions as you're walking ***next*** uh so if you walk a little bit further down here ***next*** 
uh around here ***next*** this is the singapore river ***next*** uh there are bars and restaurants here ***next*** it's very scenic ***next*** 
this is the singapore river ***next*** uh there are bars and restaurants here ***next*** it's very scenic ***next*** and if you were to uh move down a little bit more ***next***

he saw an animal so he asked "what was that i saw" ***next*** and someone said to him uh "i heard that there's an animal called the singa" ***next*** singa is lion ***next*** uh but ***next*** 
um i see ***next*** so this is a place many tourist like to go ***next*** uh to take photographs as uh you can see some of the tourist there ***next*** uh otherwise if you ***next*** 
uh otherwise if you ***next*** then if you ***next*** after you have taken your photographs you can head back along the river ***next*** and uh go down towards funan ***next***

they looks comfortable but i ***next*** to be honest with you i think it's kinda expensive ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay so this is located at the uh main city ***next*** yes located in the city area where uh most of the public transports are available ***next*** okay sounds good ***next*** okay you can see from the map right now um the blue uh icon which is here ***next*** 
yes located in the city area where uh most of the public transports are available ***next*** okay sounds good ***next*** okay you can see from the map right now um the blue uh icon which is here ***next*** uh it's hotel eighty one bencoolen ***next*** 
okay you can see from the map right now um the blue uh icon which is here ***next*** uh it's hotel eighty one bencoolen ***next*** it's a twostar hotel ***next*** if you're going for threestar then it will be a lot more costly ***next*** 
so that's why you're going for a budget hotel ***next*** yes you can see down there it's written down there this is a budget hotel right ***next*** compare to the uh normal hotel you're looking at ***next*** so and it's not only that it's close by to the train system ***next*** 
the cc one and ne six ns twenty four ***next*** uh these are the kind of trains connecting train ***next*** that means at these area it's an interchange of trains ***next*** so if you were to travel going to uh northeast you have the northeast line there ***next*** 
uh these are the kind of trains connecting train ***next*** that means at these area it's an interchange of trains ***next*** so if you were to travel going to uh northeast you have the northeast line there ***next*** if you are going to uh northsouth then you have the northsouth train station ***next*** 
that means at these area it's an interchange of trains ***next*** so if you were to travel going to uh northeast you have the northeast line there ***next*** if you are going to uh northsouth then you have the northsouth train station ***next*** you also have the cc one which is circle line train system ***next*** 
you also have the cc one which is circle line train system ***next*** so it's all nearby and not only that you can also uh take a walk towards the ew twelve which is on your map ***next*** this is the eastwest bound train ***next*** it's very simple to identify ***next*** 
this is the eastwest bound train ***next*** it's very simple to identify ***next*** uh ew means eastwest ***next*** twelve means station number twelve ***next*** 
twelve means station number twelve ***next*** so this is uh how nearby it is uh to your hotel walking distance ***next*** so probably from east station uh from the station dhoby ghaut station to your hotel ***next*** probably about hm ten minutes' walk ***next*** 
what are the other things they offer at the hotel ***next*** i mean do they have uh a pool casinos ***next*** right ***next*** uh no this is a budget hotel ***next*** 
uh no this is a budget hotel ***next*** so definitely you would not be having uh those kind of facilities uh like the swimming pools and all those staff ***next*** because if you are looking at swimming then you have to ***next*** have a fullfledged hotel or something like a threestar or fourstar hotel ***next*** 
eh in fact this hotel do not serve uh food ***next*** they only uh rooms available only ***next*** you can see it from here these are the hotel facilities here ***next*** uh there are bars and pubs which are there ***next*** 
they only uh rooms available only ***next*** you can see it from here these are the hotel facilities here ***next*** uh there are bars and pubs which are there ***next*** but uh ***next*** 
but uh ***next*** but ***next*** okay but uh can i request them to uh fetch me some food ***next*** yah ***next*** 
if you are quite hungry and you don't wanna get out from the hotel room ***next*** you just need to do is to dial uh for their food like mcdonalds uh kentucky fried chicken ***next*** um you know pizza huts ***next*** and those are available through a phone call away yah ***next*** 
uh well there is a delivery charges for some of the uh fast food ***next*** like mcdonalds they do charge uh a service charge of two dollars ***next*** okay ***next*** yah additional two dollars on top of your uh food order ***next*** 
yah additional two dollars on top of your uh food order ***next*** okay ***next*** so it's uh quite reasonable ***next*** it should be okay ***next*** 
um so i~ ***next*** uh wifi is not available in my room ***next*** uh wifi is available in your room ***next*** but uh you can see down here it says internet access wireless complimentary ***next*** 
but uh you can see down here it says internet access wireless complimentary ***next*** that means that it's free inside your room ***next*** that okay i didn't notice that ***next*** yah ***next*** 
eh you have to put ***next*** laundry service are chargeable ***next*** um you have any idea how much it would cost me ***next*** uh maybe it goes by uh per unit basis ***next*** 
there is also another hotel called hotel eighty one ***next*** uh let me just ***next*** bring you back here ***next*** oh i think ***next*** 
so you know i mean with the hotel eighty one the first one that you uh showed me ***next*** um the hundred uh ten dollar fee is that for a single room or is that a couple's room ***next*** it's a couple's room ***next*** it's a twin bed there or you can also request for a king size bed or queen size bed ***next*** 
i mean how's the uh weather there ***next*** is it very hot ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** 
is it very hot ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** uh singapore weather uh the temperature is ranged between twenty six degree to thirty five degree ***next*** 
yah it's quite humid here ***next*** okay ***next*** right ***next*** um i don't think there ***next*** 
right ***next*** um i don't think there ***next*** so uh are all of the uh rooms in your hotel are airconditioned ***next*** yes the hotel rooms are air conditioner ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah i just wanna be sure i mean ***next*** uh i don't wanna feel uh thirty six degrees inside my room ***next*** no of course not ***next*** 
no of course not ***next*** okay ***next*** okay here we are we have another hotel here which is a threestar hotel known as the fragrance hotel ***next*** and let's see whether do it uh ***next*** 
it is also quite near yah ***next*** really uh ***next*** and this is a threestar hotel right ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah it's located some yah ***next*** that is the reason why uh it's uh slightly cheaper compared to the hotel that i'm talking about just now ***next*** and you can see there the distance from this hotel uh to the train station ***next*** where i show you about the dhoby ghuat ***next*** 
well how long uh will take me uh for you know to uh get to that station ***next*** how many minutes for a quick walk ***next*** you ***next*** either you can take the other station which is quite nearby which is only the train system called it ne seven ***next*** 
the only difference is that this is near to only two station ***next*** that is near to three station ***next*** uh i would say four station ***next*** that means there are connecting trains uh available just at the site ***next*** 
so it's like you know it's quite convenient compared the um uh this hotel that you are staying ***next*** eh there is only two trains that you can pick it up ***next*** one is a northeast line the other one is the eastwest bound train uh line and that's it ***next*** so same thing uh northeast line will takes you about five minutes' walk ***next*** 
and ew will takes you another about ten minutes' walk ***next*** to that particular station ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
uh what about the uh facilities ***next*** so you huh ***next*** we are uh i'm asking about the fragrance hotel ***next*** sorry i cannot get ***next*** 
what are the facilities there ***next*** i don't mind walking really ***next*** so eh anything uh that will be cheaper for me i'm all for that ***next*** okay ***next*** 
i don't mind walking really ***next*** so eh anything uh that will be cheaper for me i'm all for that ***next*** okay ***next*** okay you can see that this do come with uh ***next*** 
yes ***next*** coffee will be serve to you um i guess breakfast ***next*** i ***next*** maybe i let you see whether there's breakfast for you ***next*** 
i ***next*** maybe i let you see whether there's breakfast for you ***next*** okay ***next*** i guess hundred dollars is not with the breakfast ***next*** 
okay ***next*** i guess hundred dollars is not with the breakfast ***next*** uh we'll wait and see ***next*** uh no i don't think there is breakfast here ***next*** 
uh no i don't think there is breakfast here ***next*** but they do have a restaurant inside the hotel right ***next*** uh no ***next*** they do have breakfast ***next*** 
uh no ***next*** they do have breakfast ***next*** they do have breakfast if you are taking the executive deluxe room ***next*** the superior rooms are not with breakfast yah ***next*** 
the superior rooms are not with breakfast yah ***next*** oh i see ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
and not like this ***next*** um are there any uh specific dishes ***next*** uh i mean do they serve indian food chinese dishes ***next*** that is usually the ***next*** 
um are there any uh specific dishes ***next*** uh i mean do they serve indian food chinese dishes ***next*** that is usually the ***next*** in the hotel wise the restaurants are there ***next*** 
outside your hotel uh there is a chinese restaurant uh across the road ***next*** then if you love indian food indian curry ***next*** that you have to walk across to that train station that i'm talking about ***next*** the whole street there call serangoon road ***next*** 
then if you love indian food indian curry ***next*** that you have to walk across to that train station that i'm talking about ***next*** the whole street there call serangoon road ***next*** in fact is um a place whereby eh uh most of the indian food are sold there ***next*** 
yah i am seeing the map and uh yap serangoon ***next*** yah ye ***next*** the ne seven in the serangoon road uh which is here ***next*** yah this is the whole street whereby a lots of indian food are sold here ***next*** 
okay that sounds interesting ***next*** uh yah ***next*** yah ***next*** so instead of going very far away staying in a nice hotel in the city ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so instead of going very far away staying in a nice hotel in the city ***next*** if you stay nearby here quite near to the station ***next*** and also near to little india where you can shop around to found out more ***next*** 
okay interesting story mathew ***next*** yah ***next*** um i think i would love to uh stay there in fragrance ***next*** okay ***next*** 
um i think i would love to uh stay there in fragrance ***next*** okay ***next*** yah i mean i love indian culture so i definitely uh would enjoy my stay there ***next*** so ***next*** 
so ***next*** okay so hotel wise i guess this would be your choice right ***next*** yah ***next*** um from here then we will go to your attraction right ***next*** 
just now you were saying that you love uh theme parks right ***next*** yah ***next*** uh so uh the next one that i'm gonna tell you is about a theme park ***next*** which is uh also accessible uh by train to this theme park ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh so uh the next one that i'm gonna tell you is about a theme park ***next*** which is uh also accessible uh by train to this theme park ***next*** so this theme park the name of the theme park in fact is called the universal studio ***next***

uh if you like theme park ***next*** so here we are then you can see this is universal studio ***next*** and we have the transformer here the transformer ride ***next*** and transformer ride in fact is uh quite new ***next*** 
and transformer ride in fact is uh quite new ***next*** and uh this uh transformer has been showing in uh new york ***next*** uh but of course uh singapore is having one of the best of all ***next*** so i'm gonna show you right now um how to get there what are the ticket price which is involve yah ***next*** 
uh but of course uh singapore is having one of the best of all ***next*** so i'm gonna show you right now um how to get there what are the ticket price which is involve yah ***next*** okay ***next*** right ***next*** 
okay ***next*** right ***next*** now how to get there uh to universal studio ***next*** in fact from your hotel if you were to take um the northeast train ***next*** 
now how to get there uh to universal studio ***next*** in fact from your hotel if you were to take um the northeast train ***next*** which we call it the ne seven ***next*** from your hotel you remember right ***next*** 
the ne seven ***next*** yah ***next*** now the ne seven will take you all the way up to uh the station here call the harbourfront ***next*** harbourfront ***next*** 
now the northeast line mrt rail ***next*** okay if you look carefully you will find that this is uh little india right ***next*** okay ***next*** can you see from the screen ***next*** 
okay ***next*** can you see from the screen ***next*** yah i'm still following ***next*** okay ***next*** 
the number six right ***next*** okay ***next*** so that will be the ending part of the northeast line ***next*** and from the northeast line the same building itself ***next*** 
so that will be the ending part of the northeast line ***next*** and from the northeast line the same building itself ***next*** there is a sentosa express which is there ***next*** but the distance from your little india to harbourfront ***next*** 
and from the northeast line the same building itself ***next*** there is a sentosa express which is there ***next*** but the distance from your little india to harbourfront ***next*** approximately fare for the train ride per person is about three dollars ***next*** 
uh v i v o ***next*** v i v o okay ***next*** vivo okay ***next*** yes ***next*** 
v i v o okay ***next*** vivo okay ***next*** yes ***next*** yah from the vivo station there is a sentosa express ***next*** 
vivo okay ***next*** yes ***next*** yah from the vivo station there is a sentosa express ***next*** which eh will lead you into universal studio ***next*** 
is that the train ***next*** yes there is an express train we call it the sentosa express ***next*** if you will take a look here on your map ***next*** on your screen again you can see sentosa express ***next*** 
well eh i think you closed it that's all ***next*** still clicking ***next*** yah alright ***next*** so from your screen you can see sentosa express ***next*** 
still clicking ***next*** yah alright ***next*** so from your screen you can see sentosa express ***next*** which is located in vivocity level three ***next*** 
you can pick up the sentosa express to this station called waterfront station ***next*** this sentosa express only goes into sentosa island ***next*** and with uh universal studio is located inside this sentosa island ***next*** and it's run by the organisation called the resort world singapore ***next*** 
and with uh universal studio is located inside this sentosa island ***next*** and it's run by the organisation called the resort world singapore ***next*** so resort world is also part of sentosa ***next*** so you have to take that train to the uh universal studio ***next*** 
three dollars for the admission ***next*** if you wanna save up some money again ***next*** uh you can always do a morning exercise by taking a walk into the sentosa island ***next*** which you have to pay an admission of one dollar ***next*** 
oh by the way mathew do i have to uh pay for the sentosa express ***next*** eh yes of course ***next*** uh you wil~ ***next*** uh are you with me on the screen right now ***next*** 
eh yes of course ***next*** uh you wil~ ***next*** uh are you with me on the screen right now ***next*** can you see the sentosa express there ***next*** 
uh at the sentosa counter ***next*** alright so from little india to vivo uh mall ***next*** that's three dollars right ***next*** so they will get ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yes correct ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
if you're walking all the way to get sweat in the early morning ***next*** uh you wanna take a ride quickly to the universal studio ***next*** you just pay the three dollars for the admission at this sentosa express ***next*** then of course that is a lot more convenient ***next*** 
that provided if you are staying uh nearby to that particular area ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** let me see from here ***next*** 
oh really huh ***next*** yah but you have to walk to that particular hotel ***next*** uh how many minutes uh do you think is the walk ***next*** it's approximately about ten minutes ***next*** 
the blue icon which is there is your hotel ***next*** and summer view hotel is located at this end ***next*** here on this side ***next*** you have to walk cutting across um the street itself ***next*** 
and summer view hotel is located at this end ***next*** here on this side ***next*** you have to walk cutting across um the street itself ***next*** then you will reach the summer view hotel and you have to pick up that the sentosa uh shuttle service ***next*** 
that you need to pay for your transportation ***next*** oh you mention the ***next*** before that i have to pay three dollars entrance fee right ***next*** yes the three dollars entrance fees applies to sentosa island ***next*** 
oh you mention the ***next*** before that i have to pay three dollars entrance fee right ***next*** yes the three dollars entrance fees applies to sentosa island ***next*** it doesn't apply to the admission to the attraction called universal studio ***next*** 
so ***next*** correct ***next*** okay make sense ***next*** yah ***next*** 
i trying to pull up the season chart ***next*** and you can see uh in a while on your screen uh there is a universal studio calendar ***next*** the minute when you see the calendar just uh let me know ***next*** so that i can go through with you on the calendar ***next*** 
okay ***next*** well quite expensive ***next*** i have to uh say this to you uh it's quite expensive ***next*** well it's uh ***next*** 
and it looks like uh i'll be there ***next*** on april seventh and april eighth ***next*** which is unfortunately are peak dates ***next*** yah on the april seventh ***next*** 
then you have to prepare ***next*** uh there will be a huge crowd in the universal studio ***next*** and if you are going on the eighth ***next*** then that will be slightly better ***next*** 
uh the other express ticket allows you to join the shorter queue ***next*** that means that if you purchase an additional fifty dollars uh on top of the ticket ***next*** you have a chance to join at the shorter queue ***next*** so that it cuts uh waiting time uh for the attraction ***next*** 
okay sounds good ***next*** so that means that ***next*** that means that if you like the ride so much you can go ***next*** the second time even the third time uh as long as you enjoy it yah ***next*** 
the second time even the third time uh as long as you enjoy it yah ***next*** and if i pay the uh express uh fee ***next*** that means i get to uh ride as soon as i can right ***next*** yah ***next*** 
that means i get to uh ride as soon as i can right ***next*** yah ***next*** correct ***next*** uh as soon as the shorter queue uh available yah ***next*** 
as long as my stomach can handle huh ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** now uh let me just go back to the other one which is there ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** now uh let me just go back to the other one which is there ***next*** now coming i'm gonna show you the map inside the universal studio ***next*** 
now uh let me just go back to the other one which is there ***next*** now coming i'm gonna show you the map inside the universal studio ***next*** now if you are if your screen is ready just let me know ***next*** so that i can go through it with you onebyone ***next*** 
now coming i'm gonna show you the map inside the universal studio ***next*** now if you are if your screen is ready just let me know ***next*** so that i can go through it with you onebyone ***next*** like what is eh there to offer inside the universal studio ***next*** 
alright now if you will take a look carefully onto the lost world which my uh castle is there ***next*** now this lost world come uh with uh theme park uh rides ***next*** which is required uh the water ride ***next*** this is the only water rides available here ***next*** 
now this lost world come uh with uh theme park uh rides ***next*** which is required uh the water ride ***next*** this is the only water rides available here ***next*** uh the lost world if you ha ***next*** 
of course and then we also do have the uh if you have watched the movie called the water world ***next*** now that they are there inside this uh small green portion of uh fireworks here ***next*** uh that is the show which they are showing live ***next*** uh part of the show um not the full complete show of the water world ***next*** 
uh let you have a very nice enjoyable water rides yah ***next*** so i'll get wet with that ride right ***next*** yes of course ***next*** so in case if you plan to take this ride then you probably have to bring uh one more extra clothing with you ***next*** 
yes of course ***next*** so in case if you plan to take this ride then you probably have to bring uh one more extra clothing with you ***next*** okay alright ***next*** right ***next*** 
okay alright ***next*** right ***next*** so this is uh the lost world ***next*** then inside there inside the universal studio we also have the um ancient egypt ***next*** 
if you have catch the movie called the revenge of the mummy ***next*** uh this is actually a part of the mockup for the uh roller coaster ride ***next*** uh you know the um the mine coaster ***next*** uh that is the ride which is available inside this ancient egypt ***next*** 
so food wise is located near to the jurassic park where the lost world is ***next*** and it's also located near to ancient egypt ***next*** so those uh you can get ala carte food um indian food if you want to ***next*** so it's available there ***next*** 
how much do you think is the uh price difference ***next*** eh well uh you can't compare the street food and the food court ***next*** inside universal studio ***next*** because the universal studio have um lots of facilities inside the food court ***next*** 
inside universal studio ***next*** because the universal studio have um lots of facilities inside the food court ***next*** okay ***next*** like for example clean environment air conditioner yap ***next*** 
right ***next*** now uh then the other one is the scifi centre ***next*** scifi centre in fact uh has as you can there are so many lines which are there the blue and the red ***next*** now those are roller coaster track which is uh for the uh battlestar galatica ***next*** 
now those are roller coaster track which is uh for the uh battlestar galatica ***next*** uh this is the world fastest and tallest roller coaster ever constructed ***next*** oh really huh ***next*** i would say fastest means it complete the cycle within one minute ***next*** 
i would say fastest means it complete the cycle within one minute ***next*** oh really huh ***next*** yes ***next*** so uh that is a little bit different and in at the scifi centre we also do have uh the latest attraction now ***next*** 
oh really huh ***next*** yes ***next*** so uh that is a little bit different and in at the scifi centre we also do have uh the latest attraction now ***next*** which you see just now the transformer ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so the other part is where you can see the new york ***next*** and new york if you have you ***next*** do you know the guy which is uh producing a lots of uh scific uh movies ***next*** 
so you can just imagine there you know you have um a strong tornado coming in ***next*** you know he can create a tornado inside the theatre itself to film it ***next*** so you see how wonderful he is uh and he is been conducted inside the theatre itself ***next*** so it's a nice place to see and experience ***next*** 
you know he can create a tornado inside the theatre itself to film it ***next*** so you see how wonderful he is uh and he is been conducted inside the theatre itself ***next*** so it's a nice place to see and experience ***next*** then um the other part is um this part here we call it the hollywood ***next*** 
if you have watch the cartoon movie called madagascar ***next*** that uh is the place whereby they will be performing at the same time ***next*** there are some other rides which are also available there ***next*** then the last part will be the uh far far away which is ***next*** 
there are some other rides which are also available there ***next*** then the last part will be the uh far far away which is ***next*** if you have watch th ***next*** cartoon movie called the shrek movie this is one part the movie which they make into three d's ***next*** 
the operating hour for universal studio for the rides is ***next*** from uh nine thirty the gates will open it will start from that time ***next*** eh the last ride will be at seven that's it ***next*** eh seven will be the closing time for the rides ***next*** 
from uh nine thirty the gates will open it will start from that time ***next*** eh the last ride will be at seven that's it ***next*** eh seven will be the closing time for the rides ***next*** and after seven uh restaurants and retailer shops are still open ***next*** 
eh the last ride will be at seven that's it ***next*** eh seven will be the closing time for the rides ***next*** and after seven uh restaurants and retailer shops are still open ***next*** uh but no more rides are there ***next***

if you wanna spend time walking along the retailer shops you can also that too ***next*** okay ***next*** so this is the time table for the resort world ***next*** if you want catch the free shuttle bus i would say ***next***

alright ***next*** uh right ***next*** so the next thing is you want to know how to get to your hotel ***next*** am i right to say that ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** right ***next*** now um looking at the hotel is actually located somewhere in the city area ***next*** 
it's also nearby to orchard road if you want to go ***next*** so uh you can see the blue coloured dot which is there ***next*** a big circle with a bit narrow ***next*** that in fact is the hotel ***next*** 
okay so the blue one yah ***next*** yah ***next*** yah the blue one right ***next*** so uh ***next*** 
uh what street uh is hotel eighty one in ***next*** is it the bugis street or what specific street uh ***next*** yah ***next*** it's actually along middle road ***next*** 
and middle road is located in the city area itself ***next*** and of course you are very quite accessible to three uh train system here in singapore ***next*** uh one is the ew twelve ***next*** if you look onto your map that is actually uh bugis station ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** uh this this is for the uh mrt transport is this correct ***next*** correct ***next*** 
uh i~ ***next*** for the uh budget terminal ***next*** is this the uh changi airport ***next*** yes but it's not budget terminal but i want to say is you are travelling on a budget ***next*** 
for the uh budget terminal ***next*** is this the uh changi airport ***next*** yes but it's not budget terminal but i want to say is you are travelling on a budget ***next*** so you definitely need ***next*** 
uh it's ***next*** yah right now ***next*** yah it's fully loaded already ***next*** okay ***next*** 
you'll find that the changi airport is on the right hand side just on three ***next*** ah okay number three right ***next*** yes ***next*** now the changi airport has a train system the mrt station ***next*** 
so it's only a one ride from the airport ***next*** if you're going to the uh ***next*** if you're going to take the mrt ***next*** correct ***next*** 
from tanah merah to bugis okay ***next*** alright ***next*** and if you see there is uh two white coloured dot which is here ***next*** and that is to tell you that there is an interchange in between ***next*** 
so you are not going to use that ***next*** because you're gonna go all the way green until bugis ***next*** so from the airport towards bugis ***next*** that will takes you about forty to forty five minutes of train ride alright ***next*** 
that will takes you about forty to forty five minutes of train ride alright ***next*** okay ***next*** and for singa~ ***next*** uh for getting into the train is very simple ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and for singa~ ***next*** uh for getting into the train is very simple ***next*** almost like the similar one uh in your place ***next*** 
and for singa~ ***next*** uh for getting into the train is very simple ***next*** almost like the similar one uh in your place ***next*** but uh the thing is in singapore here in what you need to do is ***next*** 
but uh the thing is in singapore here in what you need to do is ***next*** you need to know the station you're going to get down ***next*** so when you go to the ticket counter you can um get the ticket for the bugis ***next*** uh and you'll get your refund uh of the ticket at the ticketing counter ***next*** 
well of course depends on you whether you really need so much or not ***next*** because you hardly use uh so much of the train can walk uh yah ***next*** because you're only on two days with uh ***next*** hardly spend so much yah ***next*** 
or what does ***next*** uh what time does it start and what's the uh last trip for it ***next*** right ***next*** the train system starts at five thirty in the morning ***next*** 
correct ***next*** so if you will take the train down it will leaves you back ***next*** it will leaves you to your hotel where the bugis is ***next*** yah the bugis eighty one ***next*** 
yah the bugis eighty one ***next*** okay ***next*** right ***next*** so at that area ***next*** 
and it's called the fountain of wealth ***next*** so if you want to catch that attraction you can also walk across ***next*** towards these suntec city tower one two three and four ***next*** these towers are being surrounded the world largest water fountain ***next*** 
okay ***next*** now if you were to look on to your right hand side ***next*** this is your hotel ***next*** right ***next*** 
this is your hotel ***next*** right ***next*** and we have the national library next to us ***next*** and further up you got uh stamford centre ***next***

okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so in fact uh you are also able to get access into our hawker centre ***next*** this hawker centre in fact is referring to food court ***next*** 
alright good ***next*** now if it's not a vegetarian then why it is not an issue ***next*** because most of the food here ***next*** uh if you were to go to a hawker centre ***next*** 
now if it's not a vegetarian then why it is not an issue ***next*** because most of the food here ***next*** uh if you were to go to a hawker centre ***next*** estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars ***next*** 
because most of the food here ***next*** uh if you were to go to a hawker centre ***next*** estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars ***next*** comfortably you can have one good meal with a cup of soft drink ***next*** 
estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars ***next*** comfortably you can have one good meal with a cup of soft drink ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** i heard from a friend that uh a good um how do you call it ***next*** it's a restaurant it's the uh al~ uh although a in singapore uh for the steam chicken ***next*** you're referring to our local favourite dishes right ***next*** 
now the local favourite dishes is known as hainanese chicken rice ***next*** hainanese chicken rice yah ***next*** ah okay ***next*** yah uh hainanese chicken rice ***next*** 
hainanese chicken rice yah ***next*** ah okay ***next*** yah uh hainanese chicken rice ***next*** now the hainanese chicken rice in fact is also located very near uh to your hotel ***next*** 
if you want to try the hainanese chicken rice ***next*** alright let's scroll a little bit up here ***next*** um you can see that your hotel is located here at bugis ***next*** now two street across the road you can see ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so hainanese chicken rice uh in fact once generated from that particular street ***next*** 
so you can get the traditional hainanese chicken rice from there ***next*** and the cost of it uh how much ***next*** the cost of the chicken rice if it's your normal dishes ***next*** will probably cost you around about three fifty ***next*** 
so that's cheap yah ***next*** yah ***next*** so if you order another cup of drinks probably about a dollar plus ***next*** and then makes about to four dollar five dollars per meal ***next*** 
ah okay ***next*** two year ***next*** they open two years back ***next*** and um they have recently la~ ***next*** 
uh this year they addin a few more rides which are there ***next*** and now first thing is you want to know how to get there right ***next*** yah uh from bugis ***next*** alright ***next*** 
yah uh from bugis ***next*** alright ***next*** now from bugis the direction towards that place there are a few option ***next*** one you can take the train system towards uh the universal studio on your own ***next*** 
is bus number one hundred ***next*** okay ***next*** now that bus will take you all the way towards harbourfront ***next*** harbourfront which is uh one of the uh place whereby you can take the sky ***next*** 
okay ***next*** now that bus will take you all the way towards harbourfront ***next*** harbourfront which is uh one of the uh place whereby you can take the sky ***next*** to the what you call sentosa express to the um universal studio ***next*** 
universal studio okay ***next*** okay ***next*** is universal studio also near um uh sentosa ***next*** i'm sorry ***next*** 
is universal studio also near um uh sentosa ***next*** i'm sorry ***next*** is universal studio also near sentosa ***next*** uh yes universal studio in fact is located inside sentosa ***next*** 
you can uh pick it out from there ***next*** okay ***next*** so at least for the whole day uh we can visit to uh vicinities ***next*** two place ***next*** 
so at least for the whole day uh we can visit to uh vicinities ***next*** two place ***next*** yah two places already ***next*** okay let me see whether i can pick up those ***next*** 
uh what other rides were added uh this year uh in universal studios matthew ***next*** uh one of the newest one is the transformer ***next*** ah okay ***next*** yah you shouldn't miss that transformer ***next*** 
yes i tried the ride myself it's very interesting ***next*** and of course that also depends on individual ***next*** you ***next*** are you having ***next*** 
okay ***next*** now the other way is you can also pick up some um free shuttle buses ***next*** the free shuttle buses is only available at certain location ***next*** alright uh the place where you are staying right now ***next*** 
that you are staying will be at uh the bugis ***next*** it's quite near to swiss the stamford hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** now swiss the stamford hotel is not far away from your hotel ***next*** but you will have to take note about the timing for the free shuttle bus ***next*** 
to prove that you are a visitor is singapore ***next*** you can get a free ride on this shuttle bus okay ***next*** now swiss the stamford hotel just take note this first ***next*** and i will show you the location of the swiss the stamford hotel uh right now ***next*** 
what's the speci~ ***next*** uh the fairmont uh okay ***next*** swissotel the stanford yah ***next*** correct ***next*** 
so this is the location where you can pick up the free shuttle bus ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** you have to walk from your hotel all the way to this hotel here ***next*** 
you have to walk from your hotel all the way to this hotel here ***next*** to pick up the free rides or the free shuttle service to the universal studio ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
okay ***next*** alright ***next*** so this is your transportation part ***next*** now there is the second way that you can go ***next*** 
budget ***next*** yah ***next*** okay let me pull out the other screen for you ***next*** and i'll show you how to get your ticket ***next*** 
okay there we go ***next*** two thousand twelve calendar yah ***next*** yah ***next*** correct ***next*** 
now the two thousand and twelve calendar is the calendar ***next*** which shows you about the uh ticket price to universal studio ***next*** since you are travelling in the month of august ***next*** you'll find that a lot of them are in orange in colour ***next*** 
which shows you about the uh ticket price to universal studio ***next*** since you are travelling in the month of august ***next*** you'll find that a lot of them are in orange in colour ***next*** that means that is nonpeak ***next*** 
but the one which is green in colour that is peak ***next*** because it's during the weekend ***next*** so of course weekend rate will be a lot more costly compare to the nonweekend yah ***next*** now if you're going during the nonpeak ***next*** 
because it's during the weekend ***next*** so of course weekend rate will be a lot more costly compare to the nonweekend yah ***next*** now if you're going during the nonpeak ***next*** you'll find that the adult ticket is actually sixty eight dollars ***next*** 
alright ***next*** then of course if you have two person is going ***next*** then you have the one twenty one thirty six yah ***next*** and of course you can see that there is an express pass at thirty dollars ***next*** 
but on a shorter queue ***next*** ah okay ***next*** on a shorter queue yah ***next*** so you pay thirty dollars just to get away from getting uh queuing up ***next*** 
yah along and wasting your time in the uh queuing up for the rides yah ***next*** okay ***next*** right ***next*** so this is how the price are being range okay ***next*** 
i think it's still loading okay ***next*** for the month of june and july uh it's almost at the peak season ***next*** uh why is this ***next*** now because uh starting from may the twenty sixth onward ***next*** 
it's a school holiday in singapore ***next*** the children ***next*** the school children has one month of this school holiday ***next*** they made as year school holidays ***next*** 
so if you want to get in around that time ***next*** then probably you have to pay a lot more ***next*** like the super peak is seventy four you have to add another fifty ***next*** you get about hundred and twenty four ***next*** 
now this is another screen which is gonna come up into your computer ***next*** and this in fact is the whole area of the universal studio ***next*** the whole universal studio is of ***next*** is been designed in this manner ***next*** 
is been designed in this manner ***next*** uh yes ***next*** so i saw there that's uh explore the seven zones right ***next*** yah exploring the seven zones yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** i think i saw one interesting the scifi city ***next*** scifi city ***next*** okay we go to scifi city ***next***

yah ***next*** uh that's a roller coaster ride right ***next*** now ***next*** yes indeed it is a roller coaster ride ***next*** 
there was a chase scene right there ***next*** yah a chasing ride right ***next*** yah ***next*** so that chasing ride has actually put onto this scifi centre ***next*** 
yah a chasing ride right ***next*** yah ***next*** so that chasing ride has actually put onto this scifi centre ***next*** which we call the battlestar galactica ***next*** 
we call it human versus cylon is because ***next*** both of this roller coaster will start simultaneously at the same time ***next*** so they are actually challenging their speed with one another ***next*** crisscross ***next*** 
both of this roller coaster will start simultaneously at the same time ***next*** so they are actually challenging their speed with one another ***next*** crisscross ***next*** uh cutting across one another and you ***next*** 
you have ***next*** you seen the movie called transformer right ***next*** alright ***next*** this transformer is very new in universal studio ***next*** 
so it's a three d uh type of ride ***next*** it's a three d in fact yes ***next*** you are supposed to wear the glasses and of course uh the rides will take you up and down ***next*** fronting turning swinging it's very interesting ***next*** 
it's a three d in fact yes ***next*** you are supposed to wear the glasses and of course uh the rides will take you up and down ***next*** fronting turning swinging it's very interesting ***next*** that is one of the best i will say so far ***next***

so ***next*** uh no we don't have any smoking area inside universal studio ***next*** uh you can't ***next*** if it's too tempting you cannot uh smoke ***next*** 
now uh this is universal studio ***next*** so uh if you have done this universal studio and you have some more time ***next*** uh another place that you ***next*** that i would like to recommend you is to go to sentosa ***next*** 
now uh one of the uh most exciting area that i will like you to go ***next*** is to visit the song of the sea in the evening ***next*** because the minute ***next*** once you are done with universal studio uh you would should be around about six to seven pm right ***next*** 
e~ uh ***next*** okay ***next*** how to get there is to take the sentosa express from the universal studio ***next*** two stops away and it will lead you to beach station ***next*** 
it's only ten dollars per person ***next*** you can pick it up from there ***next*** okay ***next*** right ***next***
