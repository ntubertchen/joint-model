yes
yes
so i'll just call you edrelin
yes
and you were saying that you wanted to come to singapore
okay and you will probably leave singapore on the twenty seventh
alright
okay so uh what are your son like any theme park or what is he like
what kind of food does he like then
because uh a lot of people likes to eat this food including the local people as well
it's like one straight road
you could also try taking the subway uh to your hotel which we call it the mrt
you could also try taking the subway uh to your hotel which we call it the mrt
it's pretty clear
so this is um from the east you'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station
there are two hotels there for you to choose
okay
uh three hundred dollars per room
it depends on which uh particular location that you are going to
but because if you are buying a standard card there is actually a dollar deposit
so let's say if the taxi- the mrt cost one dollar for example then you will have to put two dollars into the machine
yah
and if you are spending let's say money in the uh shopping centre uh or buying tickets to universal studio you can always pay them with credit cards
yah
or of course if you can have a bit more time you can arrive prior to twenty sixth twenty fifth
yah
alright
just go across the road
there is a little uh coffee shop
do you take spicy food
uh beef uh even sardine
and you can eat it with your hands just like the locals
but of course if you don't want you can always use the spo~ and- oh fork and spoon
but of course if you don't want you can always use the spo~ and- oh fork and spoon
but it's malay style
it's about seven minutes' walk
uh and a circle line
so once you get down to the mrt uh you will be able to see uh the map
so that is actually the east west line
so that is actually the east west line
uh and you will come to bugis
so you can stay in this hotel called landmark
yeah
at least you know you don't have to change lines
okay and after that you will have to change to the red line
you'll see clarke quay chinatown and-
so you will alight at harbourfront
so you alight at harbourfront
yah
because if you have time you can go swimming in our beautiful lagoon on sentosa
okay huh
yah
you can get by using the buses on sentosa
uh and the buses that operates on sentosa were- uh they are free
okay can you see my arrow
this arrow
uh in the park and uh you can do a lot of attractions there
uh you can also buy uh online before you arrive
uh a day pass for the adult will cost singapore dollars sixty six dollars
okay
but just to check again let me see
so like at weekend it will be at seventy two dollars for the adult and a child will be fifty two dollars
i think your son will like that
the ride transformer
uh to local food as well
okay
so because the uh universal studio opening hours it's from ten am to seven pm
the train on sentosa itself
um you go to funan centre
yah
yah
the ladies the gents
alright
they are shops
in whatever currency you like
so let's see
so- yah because the shops will open like uh ten thirty in the morning
shopping time for him
yah
so uh because right now- okay we'll- first of all we will be doing all the things the local people do because you are still young right
uh so what i will suggest is the subway is located on the eastern part of singapore in the area called changi and you can take the east-west line
too small
southwest uh south- towards the south number ten
yah
yah so what i will suggest is uh when you arrive singapore you can get a map of the subway trains and it's just like any other country in the world
so only way to save to- you save quite a lot travelling on the mrt
yah so no issue uh so every- all the information are given in english uh so it's no problem for you if you're coming from philippines
okay so now once you let say from the hotel- uh do you have any hotel in mind that you want to stay
so that is like uh bencoolen hotel bayview hotel it's just in city hall so it's fairly convenient for you
so what you do is you take the train uh of course you have to get off at expo- uh tanah merah and then you change to the next train to get down to the- uh you use back the green line the east-west line you alight at city hall
alright
um of course these are like i would say city hotel so the rooms are not that big
yah
uh we have like fashion food
and if your other friends or yourself would like to do some art uh pieces we have a very good museum just across from the national museum it's called sam s a m
yes alright
yah they have a sauna and a fitness centre
yes it's air-conditioned so you have various kind of food like uh from chinese malay indian uh even philippines food
so that's a very local breakfast
yah eat like that
it's an island of the southern part of singapore
okay and then i think you like uh swimming as well right
and since your friend like uh adventure we have the adventure park
well you can spend like uh two hours there
okay the prices are all uh stated there parajump is like per jump is fifteen dollars
yah
these are something that your friend would be keen to do
yah
so what you do in the underwater world you go inside it's located like uh below the ground area
okay
and that would be like uh weekday
yah for weekend it will be about seventy two dollars
so uh that's universal studio of course lots of things to do there all the interesting ride like uh madagascar and they have this transformer ride i think that's thrilling as well
uh i would say to four hours minimum
yah
uh of course it's not as hot and uh people come out to play so it's nice
yah you saw
uh if you like uh we have fried kway teow as well
do you like durian
so then i think uh we will just uh-
okay
and then the first day maybe do it take it easier you do a little bit of museum do a bit of shopping around your hotel area
yah
so again you have luxury brand to uh mid-range to local brands and it's also fun to just do people watching out there on orchard road
yeah
yah so-
i will suggest that you do that on the second day
so you can try a different cuisine now
so you can do- because if you're coming out by seven o'clock then you can come out and have dinner at vivocity
yah t o a
p a y o h
yah so uh that's something you can do
and then you can go to a local food centre because there were a lot of little uh food centres in toa payoh alright
orchids
and they open early as early as eight thirty in the morning to seven
yah
yes in the national orchid garden in the singapore botanic gardens
yes
uh it's actually we have a station called chinatown station
uh yes it's a buddhist taoist and confucianism
so can you see now the picture of chinatown
okay the first china town
yah
so uh uh the front is narrow but it's pretty long so they need to have some ventilation as well as light coming into the house
our tea appreciation is not as elaborate as the japanese uh but our tea if you are going to have your tea in the chinese uh tea houses the tea comes in- they are being served in small little cups
okay
welcome
my name is lynnette
lorraine is it
so you will have no problem uh getting on the subway or travelling around singapore either by bus or the subway
at the end of your trip you just remember to go back to the machine and you'll be able to get the uh refund of that one dollar
yes the green line
new hotel
but if you want to be like very near to the main shopping area walk to the museum-
you go in from the older part of the museum you go into the newer part of the museum
inside this gallery itself you'll be able to learn about the history of singapore right through from the early nine hundreds to modern day singapore
hm you can use the audio guide
alright
just cover the history part
okay because you would have a good idea of the history of singapore
in the early days
in the beginning all of them live in this place called chinatown
but eventually it gets crowded so the uh they moved away from this area
so the chinese stayed back in chinatown
yes so you can actually do chinatown first in the afternoon
okay
yes
okay
yah
yah because in the old days their houses were not air conditioned
it's a chinese temple
uh but i would say dressing-wise as in any other place of worship just uh this would be uh good enough
do a little bit of lunch
so the bamboos according to the chinese are auspicious uh symbol
and out of this main street you can go to the little streets
in all- yes
so uh you just approach uh the station master and anyway the signs are all quite clear
it's just so-called the little india arcade
and of course they use- uh they buy- the indians buy them or rather the hindus uh they buy them and offer the flower garlands to uh their gods when they go to visit the uh temples
alright
okay
yah
or if you again don't- you don't like spicy food is it
yes
alright
alright
yah
so if you're really done your museum tour that will be a good way to see uh you know how the people you uh live in these different areas
so again if you look at the map there are roads named after buffalos
yah so that's about five dollars
yah we don't get to see a lot of this tree but they are still available
so okay and just spend a bit of time just outside the mosque there's a bussorah uh mall
so uh i would say sorry uh mid-eastern kind of uh food
it's water pipes
uh bring a picnic basket uh to the east coast
yah but it maybe a bit troublesome right
and the hotels
uh okay we have the different uh festivals that's celebrated in singapore
yes it's actually uh mooncake and together it's the lantern festival
uh and just walk around where they live
so you get this uh mooncake uh kind of festival mood throughout the whole month
okay this is uh not like a nationwide festival
and of course christmas time in december we decorate all the buildings along orchard road right up to the marina square
uh we don't have a summer day but because uh well we are in the equator so it's summer throughout the whole year
so it's a birthday treat
alright
and does he like a little bit of relaxation or more adventure
right okay
so uh what you can do is- because just now you also mentioned to uh look around singapore
okay uh there are quite a number of places that you can stay
uh you buy a standard ticket
right
okay
so you have to change your train from here
okay
right
just on the tram yah
so please do not stretch out your hands or any part of your body
okay in the- alright
yes they are just next door to one another so it's totally different
so you could do a little bit of the uh chinatown area alright
then in the night you can take uh all these uh places that i've mentioned
uh you would be able to find one such store otherwise in some of our food centres you maybe a to~
alright
uh so orchard road it's one straight road
it's a place where you can do a lot of things out there
alright
okay this is like the beginning of orchard belt
yes correct
uh i think right now the local bags and shoe brand we have a home grown brand called uh charles and keith
so these are- and of course over in number forty seven alright that's plaza singapura
the post offices uh yes because it's a public area so you can just walk in to any of our post offices in singapore
uh to col~ uh to independence to merger we sing~ uh sorry before our independence nineteen sixty three to nineteen sixty five we merged with uh malaya to form the federation of malaysia
yah
so just like how you will pass through uh the immigration while coming in uh or leaving singapore the normal security uh procedure that means you have check- we will have to check your bags um and you make sure that you do not carry any uh sharp objects and uh there's no- strictly no photography inside the supreme court
yah
and the ura would be uh a good introduction to our city landscape
okay
there are mangrove and uh wetland wildlife so a lot of birds
okay
alright let's go to the hotels in singapore uh there are lots of different category of hotels so again it depends on uh what you're looking at
uh there are budget hotels
okay
we have like uh uh york hotel just beside the goodwood park hotel elizabeth hotel
okay so lots and lots of hotels available if you just want something very special
okay that's a bit far off
it's also a good location uh but they don't have facilities like the spa
so that would be in the region of below two hundred dollars per night
sentosa of course the best- uh there's a-
uh sorry what did you say
oh karting yes
yah
yes something like that
uh i wouldn't say it's like a bicycle you don't ride you know
uh no this one you will have to pay extra uh- okay there are different uh admission prices
okay sure
okay sure
lynnette here
our street signs are all in english
uh in s~ yah in singapore we have summer the whole year round
oh yes
okay once you get the card you proceed to the um entrance to the station just tap your card you go inside uh and airport that line is the green line is the east-west line
yes
there are uh hotels that are located in another area
okay
yes and you probably would require an extra bed for your nephew
otherwise yah
actually the whole stretch from orchard station right to dhoby ghaut every other hotel or building it's either a hotel or a shopping mall
so you can do lots of shopping options out there
so you sho~ yah you have to do a little bit of uh exercise before you come and do your shopping out here
so i guess for your nephew you may want to do some sightseeing uh with him as well okay
okay
uh okay you don't really have to buy it from the merlion area but there is a shop a small shop at the merlion area
okay
you alight at tanjong pagar because i'm going to introduce you to the chinatown area
then- yah so i do understand you have uh chinatown in philippines right
well just be appropriately dressed like uh no short shorts
so basically that's all uh that-
but they are not made by bamboo they are made of tiles
is uh yah
so you could have a look inside this chinese temple
see what looks interesting
in the afternoon they still keep the front gates opened
so again you will see a lot of the chinatown uh houses with this bamboo roof
okay
okay
now on sago street there are about two shops there that sells uh specifically chinese pastry
right
okay so that like you can do like a half day uh almost full day already right
okay we do have the zoo express uh that you can take
so i would suggest if you want to do two attractions you can do in the afternoon
the night safari will be uh ninety per cent- uh it's yah
and let's go to the night safari park
so you'll be getting on this tram
uh it's a open tram alright
so we don't want them to get overweight right
you get on the tram ride and in the middle uh there is a stop called the leopard's trail you get off the tram do a half an hour walk to see the animals
uh and at the e~ main entrance there is another walking trail called the fishing cat trail
so this is the shows that you can do- uh i would recommend a minimum of two hours in the night safari park
yah it's a very popular tourist spot for both the locals and the tourists
see now these lorries are free flying
yes
we do have a-
yes in the marina bay sands yes there is but not in all the other mall
uh only selected ones uh do offer this service
okay these are the flea market
okay now i'm showing you some of the images in little india
okay the first picture is a light up uh in this festival which normally happens in august
it's call uh deepavali
alright
and then we just move downwards
okay another food that is served in little india
so you take a bite on the green chili and a bite of this vadi
here again more pictures of what little india has
this is the traditional way of eating indian food and you eat with your hands
so you could do again the like three hours you know
so i think we would-
alright
yes
okay grace
yes
we- yah we have summer the whole year
okay sure
and is this your first trip to singapore
right
okay
so this is a map of the mrt
for universal studio
okay it will be better to buy uh online first just in case um all the tickets are snapped up
yes
yes
uh no normal check-in time is uh one o'clock
so what you can do is you bring your luggage i guess
do you want to eat in the uh hawker centre
okay we have uh air-conditioned food centre uh a food court in the changi airport
yes they do serve this kind of food at the changi uh food court
yes they do serve this kind of food at the changi uh food court
right
yah that is right
okay so you will sp~ so at this point of time uh you're still not sure like how many hours you want to spend there
yes you can
wait
yes but the following morning the park- unless it's sunday uh or saturday then the park open at ten am
okay so do you just want to do a walk in the park
okay from universal studio you take the sentosa express
it's a train that operates only on sentosa island and harbourfront
yes you alight at harbourfront
number ninety seven
it is a public park
okay you can stay in this hotel called the uh- this hotel call~ peninsular excelsior hotel
if you look at the map on your right-hand side
so they serve steak and seafood on a plate ca~ uh and this is like a hot plate
it's a male or a female may i ask
what are your interests
and we also have an island called sentosa that you can go to
uh drink coffee in between your shopping
here it is
and that is where we have maybe the better class hotels
affordable as in uh what sort of price range are you talking about
they usually come with a television
do you enjoy staying in chinatown or little india
the-
if you are-
okay
do you see keong saik hotel
so let me see
go and have breakfast at the little shops nearby
yah right
one of our latest malls
and uh you overlook the singapore river if you uh for example have a ice cream in one of the- there's an ice cream boutique there
and then you can take the train
oh it's very low
so you're only paying as a singaporean would pay
uh you know where you are in chinatown
let's say if you bought uh different things and you tried it on
now it's actually on the edge of the business district and chinatown
uh actually i should tell you that uh your hotel is located in what uh maybe eighty years ago was a red light district-
can i- oops just a minute
the bus bay where sentosa operates shuttle buses into sentosa on a regular basis
but the easier way is you just go to the foot the bus bay because at the bus bay again you can get a lot of variety of food
you need to- actually the good thing is to get uh what do you call it
get to the top of mount faber which is near to harbourfront
and they have a short cable car there but you want to take the main one across the harbour right
uh let me see
i mean um-
so if you went and took these rides then it would cost more
let me try to get you- uh do you have the map now
so you would be at harbourfront when you're on sentosa
because dhoby ghaut is a major interchange and there are lot- there's a huge shopping mall there
it's the circle line but it hasn't you know uh it doesn't really form a circle here
uh do you like concerts
esplanade do you see esplanade
esplanade theatres on the bay
let me just see if i can get you some photos here
and there are lot of shops in there too
they would be-
uh weekend is more um fun
grounds all events
you have-
so you have an idea of what we have
especially on a monday and tuesday i think uh
uh are you getting the schedule now for april
there's dance workshop on the seventeenth
so this is a bit more-
so-
yes uh you should bring extra money if you are buying like uh-
let me see
oh no it's- the island i'm referring to is too dangerous for me i know
and then after you walk around you can come back to the first shop
and just take a bus maybe two stops and you would be there
cabs are about three dollars upwards
um i'm very sorry i can't uh give you better news on snorkelling
so if you bring gum for two days and say it's for my personal use i don't think anyone will stop you
okay
no they- you see they want the ladies to attract the men there
that is uh- yes
let me see if i can get orchard road shops for you huh
that's at christmas time
bye julie
and uh who will you be coming with
and that would be fourteenth of may right
and what is your budget
uh one hundred
okay
okay
you can be there as early as five am to twelve midnight but i guess you won't be spending that many hours there
alright
alright
so this is for the garden visit for your plants and a little bit of wildlife like the birds uh so you can do that in the morning
do you need me to tell you how to get there
do you need me to tell you how to get there
so your main period- yes
in harbourfront you will uh get in using the uh the sentosa express
uh otherwise most of the rides would be already included in your ticket
alright so this is the universal studio
these are some of the events the past event
yah
for a number of years they have won the nightspot of the year
and do you need me to tell you how to get there
okay usually people would start going in by ten o'clock
okay
raffles place mrt and it's just right there
we have along orchard road lots of shopping
okay
okay
alright
uh remember to get the gst tax refund
alright
when you exit from the mrt uh this is the shopping centre
yes just a five minutes' walk
okay
this is another shopping centre here called ngee ann city
it's just beside ion
okay there is a sh- uh on the ground floor there is a shop that sell some uh local souvenir
okay can you see from high fashion
so how about food wise
okay singaporean food
um okay
okay
so uh do you still need to do some more photography session
okay
okay
you will have to take a bus
okay this is uh just a photo scene
okay
uh on what kind of market are you talking about
it's mainly deep fried
okay
okay these are basically lagoon so uh the uh it's a nice place and you can see people also playing uh beach volleyball
okay this uh fish reflexology it's uh like a foot massage
uh no it's just the uh fish nibbling at your feet
okay
the fishes are- you dip your feet into this pool and the fishes would nibble at your uh feet
and of course if you want to do body massage these are the various uh uh centres that you can uh do your body massage
you will have to take uh mrt and a bus
just for the uh night safari park right
alright it will take about- it will take you forty minutes to go around the park
the first picture that you saw okay is the fire show
the show timing would be in uh at seven thirty eight thirty and nine thirty uh provided it is not raining
for example uh the orang-utans the chimpanzees
so we hope to see you uh soon in uh singapore
hello good morning
oh
j e s
uh no i have six
you are filipino right
oh
oh electronic
uh huh
si~ depends on-
but it's in that locality
uh i'm gonna give you the name of a hotel uh which is practically next door
and you can see- uh can you see it on the screen
uh if you walks fast it's five minutes
uh your thousand singapore dollars is for your stay and your travel right
okay you can walk then
yes that's a hundred and forty eight dollars
but uh-
you could take a bus maybe two bus stops or one bus stop
uh it's only fifty five dollars yah
i will try and get you more on this hotel
yes
yah
since they're using the name yah
uh i'm losing your voice now
uh yes
you see these were the conditions
yes the fair
okay centigrade about thirty three degrees
okay
so what- this one's over
uh no uh when they just- there is a fair it is a specific fair
but that is september right
there are different shops
uh huh
but then on the trains it's only about four minutes or five minutes off peak the most
yes smooth yah
it's uh-
is that right
and you could swim there
sentosa island is here
so from chinatown you just take a train to harbourfront
at the it shops uh i think they would accept
yes you can change at the airport and then go to the basement where the mrts which stands for mass rapid transit
no sungei is a river and buloh is river
yah
you can take a train up to kranji
can you see this
so at the kranji when you get out of the train you come out on the road you wait for this bus and you pay him three dollars for a two-way transfer
jurong bird park
okay
so just remember this uh website when you come and see
you know what i mean
also dirtying the place
and in the airport i don't think they want you to use your camera
uh i think you ask whoever looks like a monk in there first before you take the photograph
yah so as not to offend them it would be a bit better
this one is just a few years old but the other one it has been restored but uh the last time i went about a month ago they are still restoring parts of it so maybe the back you can't go
okay
uh sorry i didn't get you
places
so we have like the chinese culture
for the culture side we have uh the chinese culture
i'm going to show you
and then when the people in the past come to singapore
alright some of these houses have carvings outside their houses
alright
uh where do the chinese uh used to live uh in the past
and there are some pictures on your right-hand side
uh so this is the scene uh what you can see in chinatown
it is not a very big museum
it is not a very big museum
there are no escalators
yes
uh the first king of singapore is called sang nila utama
and he uh named us singapura from temasek he renamed us as singapura uh and that's how singapore gets its name
so we do not have any more kings here
so we do not have any more kings here
it's the- uh raffles is from uh britain
yes for trade and business
yes
so it's actually consists of quite a number of lanes
uh so uh you will see yes worshippers going in to worship
sorry
restaurants
uh yes the- especially the younger people and the young at heart
okay
and the closest mrt stop for you would be at this station called the uh tiong bahru mrt train station
okay
so you understand what i mean right
so you understand what i mean right
yes
and it's all uh it related products in there
i mean the rooms are pretty small
okay
so these are-
uh budget hotels
okay
okay
so now i can recommend you an- uh this is actually a backpackers' hotel and it's located in another cultural place called kampong glam
uh this is the location of the uh sleepy sam
alright
alright
otherwise we do have also uh another malay food called uh mee soto
uh okay so this will be malay food
yes you get your rice and uh you have this uh dishes like for example fried chicken uh vegetables but of course they are spicy
okay
yes
so you are coming on the fourteenth it's fine
uh yes
uh otherwise if you are not so uh properly dressed uh the- uh sultan mosque will provide a cloth uh for people to wear tourists to put over their clothes uh if they are not properly uh covered up
okay
it's member- uh when everybody came here they live in chinatown area
they are three-wheeled vehicles
yes
yah so this is a traditional dress
uh no for the museum it's okay
let's see any upcoming um-
sorry
alright oh that will be for mother's day
uh lots of things to see very different uh culture from the other two cultures that i'm talking about
how do their house look like
so they are still very much uh traditionally
so they actually mix uh in their house the traditional one
bye
two days is just one night you know
two days is just one night you know
easter
is it easter
is a guy like you
and your friend is
uh people also
so you don't mind if it's a bit uh not so roomy like hotel because you just back to sleep
if you take a dorm bed per person only twenty dollars
if you take a room it's two single beds at fifty nine dollars
and that would be fifty nine for two beds
if you went for example all the way to chinatown so you will have to cha~ take a change of trains
you put money into the card then after that you don't have to worry about having enough change to uh pay the fare
if you are at a budget hotel- uh budget airport you have to take a shuttle to the main airport and then go to the bus stat~ to the um train station and-
to uh i think the easiest way is to go to outram park
yes
two three stops down
not vietnamese but there is uh kampong glam which you have to go by bus because- well actually you could go by train because you are young and healthy you can walk
you go to um city hall station
and then you take the red line which is called the circle line and you get just one stop at city hall station
and when you get off ask the direction to beach road
um most singaporean's will not know what you mean when you say curfew
ah okay
uh i don't know whether the priest will be happy if you are using your flash taking photos
uh and if you are really into bird photography it's from about september to april
actually if you come now right away you can still catch some brids uh that are coming from mongolia
but the alternative is if you miss this you take the public bus and then you have to walk about half a kilometre from where the bus stops to the reserve
and you see the rest of stops on the kranji express
but i think sungei buloh itself is enough to interest you
so um you could time yourself so that when you come out of here you could go to the bird park so that if no birds waive at you at this park you go to the bird park and they all be smiling at you
okay
so this is the bird park but okay i'm going to see uh ticketing alright
the night safari
uh they have something cute called the bongo burger
here it's okay
yes it is
j e a n n e hi mirelle
j e a n n e hi mirelle
hi as well
oh that- that's wonderful
uh when are you thinking of coming
okay
let me get into the website
uh i'm not one for rides and things like that
they are very luxurious and comfortable- and within walking distance of the um theatre and- you're on an island on sentosa island
uh let me get the package for you okay
um i'm trying to get the package to appear
uh usually they wi-fi air-conditioning
uh and bring an umbrella in case of rain if you are travelling within sent~
yes
in april yes it may rain
if you want to look at the hotels let me do hotels first then i will come to the other attractions
okay
yah that's right
in a friendly manner you know
so if you look down can you see a purple line that goes from uh the south of the island to the- north
can you see ha- you can see harbourfront
that is where the m hotel is
hangout yes
the location is at upper wilkie road which is within walking distance to an mrt station called dhoby ghaut-
in singapore you can get food anywhere anytime
so you have a picture of the room
oh dear
just now i found for other people even cheaper rooms in chinatown but i think this is also fine
uh this hotel the one footprints that we are looking at now it's in the little india area
uh they are reasonable should i say
and if you turn to the left there walk along serangoon road there are about three four hindu temples
and if you walk to the back of it there is a buddhist temple
yah
we used to have it on sentosa and uh i don't know if they still have it now
uh okay zip-line adventure park
yah so you really have to be an adventurist to do it
let me see if they have price
zip-line sentosa should have it
no they are showing-
sentosa
yes
alright
yes
i don't know
what- so you like um uh you know like universal studio right
that's right
have five or six days
i'm a relaxed traveller i like to do things slowly
i'm a relaxed traveller i like to do things slowly
yes
just two stops away
that's where changi
airport is
at uh number eight
and if you move up to the little india stop there you are
say in the morning
you at-
and we have this website called hungrygowhere
yes
that's right you don't have to worry about it
and uh- yes that's right
so it's a bit cheaper yah but you can get your balance value so it's not a problem
uh maybe when you do little india you do chinatown as well
two stops on the line
okay
yes
two days in singapore uh
and- friday to sunday okay
okay and the other one will be tanjong beach
so there is no uh differences on whether you are coming in january or december uh in terms of our weather
so there is no uh differences on whether you are coming in january or december uh in terms of our weather
we don't have uh earthquakes we don't have tornados
and uh they are very safe to swim because uh you have uh what we call lagoons
yes so it's safe to swim in the lagoons and also in the lagoons itself you have these buoys
yes
so you don't have to travel you know to many areas
so we have different sections uh i've given you some of the attraction that is found on the island where you can do
yes everything will be in singapore dollars
yah it's call- is a show it's a water laser and fire show
uh yes uh of course weekday then you don't have to um have a queue uh in the- of course the more popular rides like the transformer rides
disneyland
yes correct
yah and it is actually the same chain as the uh shangri-la hotel
oh the location
okay there will be two adults and one child
yah and it right on the beach okay
okay
so if you just walk down uh you will come to this shopping mall called the um uh far east shopping centre
okay so there is a red building just a five minutes from the mrt uh and again there are all tiny shops
okay so this is uh a visit to the science centre and it's quite interactive as well
you can take the subway again the mrt and goes towards the western part of singapore
okay so some of these are permanent exhibitions and they are always there all the time
yes there are uh signs are all written in english
yah so-
two dollars and twenty cents singapore dollars
uh for child up to sixteen years that would be five dollars
yah
yes
so maybe i can recommend you uh to do like our street food
so that is something that is uh i think not found in your country
yah
if you are talking about very exotic food
okay and that is- okay what is satay
okay the fast food that is available here would ranges from mcdonalds uh mcdonalds right up to wendy's kfc
yah
but otherwise our tap water is very clean uh in singapore
yah
hold o~
twi~ twin is separate beds and uh- uh twin and double is the same
is just that whether you have- you want to squeeze-in one big bed or you want to have your own tiny bed
if you are staying just one night you have a good choices uh for uh that one night
and your hotel look at it on your right
ex~ exactly
but i don't think you want to work on one day do you
let me see if they are pictures of-
do shopping and you could walk around uh in the evening
just let me give you the rates first
so i'm waiting for the rates to appear right now
yes that is right
that's okay right
clarke quay is where you get off and you have to- you may have to walk across the river
there's number one there
the simple food is it
oh you are lucky
crabs especially
uh no usually it's a set meal
it's- let me try and get it for you
yah steamed and it's actually got a bit of soup inside the dumpling which is unusual
do you want indi~
and it's the favourite of the locals here
it's at bugis junction
yes and it's- so you could also shop there if you want that whole area-
uh there is a lane there that you can shop
bugis is the name of the uh one of the peoples from indonesia that came over and settle there uh two hundred years ago
yah
uh wait
so there are concerts and there are also uh shows um sort of- during the different periods of time like during chinese new year we have more chinese themed concerts
oh
uh it depends on the type of show
and then in evening you might want to uh go and see the shows what the one show
yah the merlion
so we have the top and the bottom joined together
and you can get lots of tourists or tour guides to help you take photos there
a house for a day
okay then
ac~ you said if you go to the you know when i told you you take the wrong journey from the airport there's a holiday um- there are holiday bungalows that you can rent
welcome
yuki
hm yes
okay fourth to the sixth of april
and uh unfortunately because maybe it's so close to the date-
oh that's high
if you don't spend a lot on your uh hotel accommodation
and you can in fact take a riverboat ride in the bay
so that you know officially you've got permission
travel secret
uh you- i suggest that you visit the bird park on one day at the same day that you do your city tour or- you know you travel- you can travel by yourself to little india- and the ma~
can you see
you could go to the bird park first in the morning
uh huh
yes
so when you go to the bird park you buy the three in one ticket
so you might want to leave your eating for the next day
usually the places there are signs to remind you not to litter and usually it's at places where you eat
i won't say it is the cleanest
uh we do have a lot of cleaners to pick up after ourselves actually
if you get into the island uh there's no charge for swimming except if you use the lockers
yes indeed it is very romantic
but if you don't want to spend so much money there are also uh food stalls or rather shops that sell food that is not very expensive
the beach when you enter the island it's a two dollar charge
uh and then on the beach it's free
overnight
okay are you getting the resort now
right
the other end
okay that's two adults huh
it's really-
and you wanted a museum right
but recent archaeological diggings have found that in fact there was trade here over a thousand years ago
so when you order uh he will chop up the portion you like whether it's the thigh the wing or the breast
and there on the fourth or fifth floor there are uh places selling filipino food
uh and- well i personally know of people who get filipinos to cook for their parties
and they just do it on a personal basis but they charge for it
can i just show you the museums first
because you're asking me the website that has come out here
so we have- uh in the museums we also have sometimes temporary exhibits from other countries uh that come in
yes uh hm
right by the river
so it's cooler it's very nice
when you come out you're looking at it
okay
uh the one on the hotel- at uh sentosa right
the hotel would actually have a uh shuttle into town
it have
but i know they will drop off in the town area like orchard road and also where there's dining places
by the public transport maybe forty minutes
yes it's more than enough
no it's uh very cheap
and how do i address you
yes we have uh- so which price range are we talking about
what is the price for this hotel is it
i've s~ sorry the price range is around two hundred
uh yes
okay uh in this hotel itself uh they have a restaurant
uh okay in around the merli~ uh the marina bay uh it's also a wa~ a nice walk because uh you are just walking around the bay front
uh and in the night time uh we do have a show that is um you don't have to pay for this show at the marina bay front
uh and in this zoo you will see our largest collection of the orang-utan
yes
yes this is open in the daytime
or do you want to consider doing ethnic places in singapore
uh most of the people here would be third generation uh singaporeans
so or if you look at the uh photograph
so this market is what we call a wet market
uh which date are we talking about
okay
uh it's just called uh link l i n k
yes they have uh online booking for this hotel yes
the owners of the birds they'll be bringing out their birds in their cages and they
again it's a different experience altogether
so any other thing uh that you like to do or your son would like to do
okay i'm gonna show you uh the christmas light-up uh in uh last year
yes you can it's just uh a walk of about ten minutes and you are in uh orchard road
yes and every year the theme will change
uh but our latest one would be the one at pasir ris
uh we have like uh uh mangrove area
see this is very nice to walk around there are broad walk for you to walk
that's pasir ris park
yes correct
yes
alright
so what do you- what the both of you like to do
okay sure
uh less then hundred to hundred and forty nine
uh slightly above hundred would that be alright with you
okay for your child
okay
uh you can always go to the city hall mrt
uh for the period of april we do not have any major festivals coming up
uh period the- uh preparation before uh the actual festival
uh the next uh major festival would be hari raya in august
and deepavali in the month of november
see some nature
okay you can see some pictures now
uh and in fact our bukit timah nature reserve has one of the um- a lot of uh flora and fauna as you climb up the hill
okay
and of course do not wander off the normal trail
do not wander off the normal walking trail and you will be fine
so when you alight uh when you climb down from the tree- uh from the hill just go across the road and there will be quite a lot of eating places out there
so maybe- yes so maybe at the same time if you're going to climb uh bukit timah you can also bring along some snacks with you
so it's an open zoo
so i'm showing you the- uh okay i will show you the uh attractions-
okay
i think this will interest him the polar bear
uh we have so many things to see in singapore so if it's just a one day programme-
and after your river cruise you could have a dinner
yes you can see the boat now
on this kind of river cruise it's about a half an hour cruise
the cruise will cost you fifteen dollars for an adult
if you look on the right-hand side uh can you see the blue shaded area
so you can walk around and choose a restaurant that you like
but of course there are lots of other things that you can do in singapore
so there are lots of rides there as well
uh for both your son and yourself or more for your son
yes the admission charges uh for the science centre uh would be-
and uh it's the interchange between the east and the west line
from there when you come out you will just walk about ten minutes and you get to the singapore science centre
the sand is a little bit um coarse
okay so if your son is really into animals you could do the afternoon zoo
now if you look at the first picture
now it's on the screen now
bye
um what are your uh dates of travel
you could stay till april the first
you are sh~ having shared toilets
and it is a~ it is~
and the only thing is you have to uh-
i'm trying to get a fairly nice hotel
but in chinatown we do have boutique hotels that would cost you a bit more
yes
okay
i also have another titbit for you
but it is all cleaned up now and that's why we have hotels there
so what you do is when you arrived change your money at the airport
there are signs leading you uh to the mrt
that's right
it's also a very big shopping centre uh with restaurants cafes
a little garden nearby as well
do you mind chinese food
this is a very special chinese food
uh okay
are you familiar with cold crab
people are used to chili crab
uh it has got gravy to go with it as well
i don't know if you like vinegar
uh there is also something called jelly pork
and it's very tasty
so it's almost like you're eating a dessert that is savoury in taste
uh they have also something like deep fried pork and liver roll
uh yam paste is quite a sweet dessert
and quite often in chinatown they display their menu outside so you can gauge what the actual prices of the food you are going to eat will cost
okay
can you see that
so you switch you go to the circle line which is the yellow line
and it shouldn't be too crowded
but if you're in a hurry then you just go just behind the food centre a few steps away to the bus bay right at the corner next to the mrt station and you board a shuttle bus that goes into sentosa directly
yes that's right
but yah um you are not coming on a public holiday right
it's under ten dollars for each of you
and you'd be very happy after you get your yes answer
and you get to see views uh of the hotel marina bay sands
uh you could walk in fact along the river or you could from your hotel in chinatown take the line to little india and soak in some indian culture in that area
because they- yah they close around twelve to about four o'clock and then they reopen
but if you missed it you can go back later in the uh around four something
you can both be very happy
uh the museum is accessible by bus and by train
you take the west line uh right down to like just hold on a minute
sorry
so it gives you not only the history of singapore but of uh- well we have artefacts from india from china and also from the middle east
uh when you get off at city hall they are all within walking distance of that area
born again christian
uh it is in fact shaped like a cross if you are in a helicopter above it
and it's a very active church they-
there's a huge tv screen and you can watch international matches
although that is not held in singapore
i would suggest along the singapore river
but it's not actually
you know the first stamp in the world is called the penny black
the thian hock keng temple
this is- you see this temple is a bit new
this is uh tour guide one
okay alright
and you have two days in singapore
oh okay yes it's a capsule
um let me try and see- okay
so that would be for two person will be twenty nine uh fifty times two for two adults
okay the universal admission is sixty eight dollars for weekday
the price range for this hotel is in the range of about four hundred and above
so if you are talking about very close and this hotel is possible to walk to the uh harbourfront
yah
but if you like to have um street food there is a street food call the chinatown complex
uh so if you're going to take photography uh on the animals then please switch off your um flashlights
on the tram ride the malayan tapir comes very close to the tram right
so you can see that on the screen now
uh so i think there are lot of nice uh animals that you can see but uh i would say uh personally for me i think these are very exciting
yes
okay the sh~
uh not necessary about three hours is already good enough
okay and we have our latest of addition we have a baby giraffe that is just born
in our night safari
okay do you- do you like to do a little bit of sport extreme sport
yes it's rock climbing
okay so yes we do have uh the trainers that will be uh teaching you how to climb at this wall alright
yah so this is- yah just going to show you
are you quite fit
now i'm showing you
we have something uh quite interesting
otherwise if you enjoy meat okay like pork uh we have this barbecue pork slices uh so you can get them from this shop that specia~ or even you see them barbecuing meat it's marinated meat so it has that tinge of sweetness in a meat and you can buy them back home alright
heavy meal
so it's tasty
it's actually white radish
generally it should be a travelling time about half an hour
there are quite a few clubs there as well
alcoholic okay
singapore gin sling yes
uh it's locally concocted
yah so it will be a bit cheaper compared to zouk
okay see you then
and this is lynnette
hi warren
now bukit timah hill i'm just going to show you some images of the bukit timah hill
alright but please do not get off uh the normal walking trails
the bukit timah hill
okay uh yup
uh it's just a place where the local people chill out over the weekend
so in the war- uh sky diving uh stimulator
yah
okay the price will be eighty nine dollars uh for an adult
okay
okay
um and i think borderx is still very affordable as well
uh wakeboarding it's somewhere near the southern part of singapore
now again the skate park you could combine that with the uh swim over at the east coast area and the cable ski
um are you talking about ethnic historical places
uh more activities you see a lot more in chinatown uh sometime during the january period
so it can uh cost you like thirteen dollars or twelve dollars for one kilogram
yah so you can buy a few pieces which you just want it or just to uh for people to try one piece of uh barbecue pork slices would be a quarter of our uh laptop slice
alright
the festival itself is just one day yah
yes it's just for the one day festival
this is a chinese festival
uh you can easily finish kampong glam in two hours
so you can try that
but this is just some of the street scenes over in this lane huh
okay it's trendy uh and the most of this are own by young entrepreneurs
uh yes
were you just mentioning about universal studio earlier on
okay universal studio is a theme park
to the universal studio
weekend will be seventy four dollars
and the child will be fifty dollars and um weekends would be fifty four dollars
yes so you could do these two activities uh in one day
theme park uh-
again you can eat them from uh major- i mean from most of our food centre air-condition non air-condition or even restaurants chinese restaurant they offer this um uh to uh the guest
yes
okay yes they are driving kites
up to go up there
you have- that's right
uh like i mention everywhere you go in singapore will probably take you only uh half an hour to one hour if you are taking the public transport
huh
yes and uh some of the museums are not that big
reflections at bukit chandu
so at this particular building um uh and around the hill area that was the last battle just before singapore surrender
right
yah
so like i said you just have to shortlist you know
okay
no they are- like i mention it's between twenty over dollars uh to fifty dollars
okay
it's-
so all this uh um yah
uh but the bands you will have to go back to mainland
okay we have uh club that does uh local bands
wow a lot of things that you have to do here
okay just to tone down things a little bit
uh in the night time uh you get to see the lights and there's a commentary on the cruise itself
yah uh it's used to ferry goods in the past uh this kind of boat
could you spell your name again please
okay in may
what are your interests
yes singapore is a hub for the rest of southeast asia uh we have also very good connections by air and by sea
a theme park okay
and this the night safari tram ride which you can take uh if you are too tired to walk or you can walk as well as you know take the ride
uh at night we have a tribal show uh at the night safari where they recreate what the tribes do in borneo
so it is one- under one umbrella organisation and that means you can buy a package ticket with a built-in discount
you know when the animals die they have these specimens
so they are trying to re-create these zones within the river safari
it's to encourage the animals to be in the light so you can see
you're not going to-
if you go early enough you can breakfast with wildlife
yes that would be fun isn't it
and you see you can use it within a month within thirty days
so you could even take one at a time
okay
uh there's another show and it's called the voyage de la vie it is at the sentosa resorts
so what sort of shopping are you looking for
so you should be able to get prices that are not so um high-end over there
if you want to break his bank you go to some of the other store
the rooms are very interesting uh that he even has a suite on the uh top floor
uh we can check shall we start
not a- okay
oh it's very safe
oh no it's- uh you saw the picture it's been totally refurbished
and totally renovated
uh you can also take uh junior suite then
junior suite i'm trying to get a picture of it for you
and you may notice that deluxe and the suites have the same decor
oh yes
yah fifty eight dollars is one of the lower price range well take it at a hundred and eighty dollars for the three of you
then you'll get your change before you leave your airport you go to the counter and get a refund
uh two dollars each yah
uh there is a chicken rice store- uh there are i think two stores there you just look for the one with the longest queue
you know prata it is a dough that is fried and we take it with chicken curry or fish curry or mutton curry
and uh even if you don't go to this market uh you can walk along the streets in chinatown and you will be able to find thai food you'll be able to find um malay food uh even our muslim restaurant
uh it's actually along the street side
uh here you can see some uh i don't know if you're interested in these chinese uh artefacts
uh yes
so in in china they are used to keep chinese medicines even liquidised medicines inside these containers
okay these are the chops- these are the fans
paper
maybe about ten dollars only i think
yah
yes you see the chinatown hawkers
and here it's cooked
you can cross the street in chinatown safely
oh that would be- yes
who are you traveling with
so it's twenty first to twenty third of september
you're gonna ask me something
you can buy the ticket for the two days
you can buy at places that are not so premium for watching
padang grandstand it is our old colonial district
if you buy-
yes that's right
and this is all the sea
all your credit cards uh would be acceptable
well even at the backpackers joints uh there are some a little bit better value in the sense that uh for those who want privacy let's see if we can find one for you here
okay
so air conditioning is like a must in hotels
uh it depends on the hotel
and uh it's thirty three dollars a night
closer to a hundred dollars you might be able to get a room uh of your own
uh but two hundred and fifty is actually a very great good great hotel
let us try less than a hundred
so then you can stay two nights right
okay
because the hotels know that it's a very popular period
it's also just one stop away from the race venue
i have uh passed by a few times
and looks uh quite good from the outside
uh if you're on the beach road hotel you- it's a very short walk
i mean i suppose you could hop up a bus and take it for one stop
they are like coffee shops
yes for one night
i don't have prices for the items
and they have them bigger and it depends on you know what it is made of
on the right side
okay
uh the chicken is boiled with pandan
yes
that is something that's a favourite with locals and with tourist as well
that would be your carbohydrate
it's a sweet
no would- this would be much less
uh they only li- raise prices uh for some restaurants during the lunar new year
uh which collects rainwater that falls in the city
you- well you can ask them to reduce the chili
ethnic food would be the food you get in little india
um during chinese new year we have another one
we say auspicious things in chinese to bring us wealth good health lots of grandchildren and things like that
it's- yes
it's a mall
no not restricted
so your computer shops are there
if you walk fast just five minutes
and they have you know old fabrics and uh artifacts that would suffer from too much light
it's a room where you find out about uh the islamic culture and they have got old calligraphy uh small little e~ korans you know the holly book for the muslims with hand drawn calligraphy
uh so let me see huh
so they are not low price
the- if you take the beach road- the hotel that was located at beach road that one is walking distance
and that's only one two three four stops
and the rest of your rides would be from little india uh down to- if you want to go to chinatown it's two stops
uh and also to where you eat
you see the bay
beautiful view for the background
if you uh don't want to get off at clarke quay you can also go to city hall from dhoby ghaut
can you see
but when you go out of the city it is above ground for some parts
they can get home near enough to their homes
i really cannot think of any unsafe area as long as you don't um you know wear jewelry like gold chain and gold uh you know some people- some men like to wear gold bracelets you know that are solid gold and cost thousands of dollars now
okay
goodbye
bye
d o g dog
you cannot carry your dog with you in the hotel and bring it into singapore
okay uh hm
oh so that's not really backpacker right
okay animals
uh it is in what- some of us considered a little shady part of singapore
uh if you stay in chinatown
uh ninety dollars is actually a very good deal
it doesn't say wi-fi right
in your room
yah this is the picture
and the buildings were totally renovated
uh it is- as our system is known as mass rapid transit
it's on uh slightly quieter part of chinatown
and i key in the amount i want to pay for whatever i'm buying
i sort of naturally speak singlish a little bit
so huh
yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
uh when i get back to the screen i'll show you
but--- so where you saw the birds feeding just now
or if you are brave you put the seed on your hand and they will feed of your hand
uh can i show you the other attractions first and then i come to the pricing
yes so i suggest to-
so you-
so they want to keep it under control
this is the leopard cat
those are anteaters
and they will tear off which ever portion they want for your visit
so that's about sixty dollars or fifty-eight dollars for both of you
you have a lot of money
because uh it's now connected by underpasses where we have shops even in the other pass
so you can shop and eat and shop and eat
uh you are looking at some of the high end brands here
there's a lot of street side shopping in chinatown
or if you buy one it's two dollars
uh when you know it's nice to give something to people when you are away also
yes
we'll try and get you pictures of some of the items in chinatown
can you see that
so this is the scene
but sometimes they go for sixty-eight and even less than that
two golf clubs there
there are beach umbrellas
where that you can order from
uh when you come in from the airport and you at number three
uh the other way if you want to go to sentosa
but it's more convenient to just take the bus shuttle in
yes
it runs a shuttle
in other words they collect it when you enter
uh let me have a look
that's right
uh water skiing
and this is a controlled environment
and it was a tourist who said to me "did you see the dolphin"
you will stand on the travelator
okay a hundred and twenty dollars if you actually bring your diving suit and dive
so that's good right
some people find it a little bit too ticklish
um do you have anything else you would like to ask
uh maggie uh nothing else to ask
look forward to see you maggie then
how can i help you dodie
yes
very young
so okay
because there is no entry fee to the beach
but whether on the island if you want to visit attractions then it's- uh whichever attraction you pick uh it has a fee
and if you come out of there
so- hm okay
so this mass rapid transit is partially above ground where there are space and partially underground
walk down most probably
the green line was developed first the green and the red line and this is an additional line that goes straight up northeast
you just uh make sure that you are heading northeast
so outside the train line there are signs to tell you which direction
okay so chinatown is the best location because it's near the singapore river where you can have althe- al fresco dining if you don't want to eat outside your hotel
just a minute
we're trying to catch it
but it's been completely refurbished
okay uh later- you can go and do shopping uh at the street where people used to wait to die
but i haven't been in this other one
yes on the same street
uh you can walk out 'til midnight you know
okay
you may
these are low-rise buildings
i thought you'd not scared of ghosts
can you see the rooms there
you can take a-
uh when they've opened it was fully booked for many months
there are several churches in singapore
but of course it has been uh repaired and uh upgraded many times
yah you can visit the churches in the daytime
yes i am catholic
uh this church served to the eurasian community
all three of them
yes very pretty
uh national museum you may even get free entry because it's a- if it's a public holiday
if it's good friday you are here- uh you se- you- will you be here on good friday
uh i cannot quite remember the name
it's probably another one
yes it's in the same area
yah
it's a chinese term
and-
that means you are eating good food or delicious food at good prices
uh is just opposite the cathedral
lunch there will be more stalls open
because the students would be there during the day time
yes it's the same location
so- and so you could have your lunch at the smu
i call it smu foodcourt because i identify it with the university
uh where the number a- can you see the a there
uh but on the opposite side of bras basah road there is another food court there
they usually have seating inside and outside
uh the sun is going down
okay
and if there is a match like a football match going on overseas people sit there and have drinks and watch the match
uh the former emblem of the singapore tourism board
uh it~
but remember i said to buy a ezlink card
so you top it up- maybe you put in more money and then you'll get uh bigger refunds
hm no twenty dollars so about thirty
do you want to go to the zoo and the night safari
and i can show you pictures of three uh parks that is run by this uh company
oh no the package is per person
so if you decide where you want to go and then you uh buy the ticket on your first visit then you hold on to the ticket and on the next- at the next park you just present the same ticket
no then the birds will eat up your tongue
they are baboons
uh i'm not sure if this is one but you know the giraffes that you see here
they are uh malayan tapirs
yes they are very tame
so i'm suggesting you go to the zoo in the afternoon
uh it's somebody who's walking on a rope just above your heads
uh but you know when you go there if you don't want- you're not comfortable with the animals right above your head you just avoid the- overhanging uh rope and you just go little bit further back and you can see it as it goes along
they have something called the bongo burger which is the name of an animal
so one month before uh the date in august uh we do light up the street in kampong glam as well as geylang serai
so after this uh month of fasting or we called it puasa uh the muslim will celebrate with this major festival called hari raya
yes and of course they do uh eat their normal meals
um again same thing before the preparations for this festivals uh the indians do not fast
okay sari is uh worn uh by the ladies
okay let me just-
hm so they look very beautiful right
so it's a matter of wrapping uh around the waist
and basically in short it's actually a festival to celebrate the triumph of good over evil
and the-
uh and of course a lot of homes they tends to make their own uh so-called uh sauces uh and we call them masalas
alright
yah
uh not special it's the way that it's cooked uh that is special
let see
uh what i meant by walking is well you can stay anywhere in singapore
so uh now you have this image of last year the whole street of orchard road is lighted up
what we do is we close this street
so we have the longest runway alright
okay you can choose this hotel
so it's the esplanade alright
uh this is our theatre so we can see uh what are the acts that will be coming what are the acts or musical that is in town uh-
uh yes
it's on the bay called marina bay
alright they have uh a gym uh of course the uh a restaurant
lots of shop- uh restaurants
you can see the whole list of the restaurants out there
so lots and lots of uh shopping and uh restaurants option
okay this museum it's um contemporary museum uh and it is also dedicated to the art and science
the last exhibit was the titanic exhibition so you have artefacts that were uh salvaged from the titanic the boat titanic
okay and-
there's a very famous club on uh marina bay called ku de ta
um i don't know whether you are familiar with this club but it's uh world famous
this is the club that i'm going to show you
yah
well that's the brand name of this club
so for- usually for people who do clubbing um they would like to go to this club because it's a place for you to be seen at and even bump into some celebrity
okay
uh yah
it's just across the bay
okay for the period of march yes they're having this uh the indie disco club
so you have a lot of options
welcome
okay
it's not that far away
sure just give me a call again
and this is lynnette speaking
romantic right
well we don't have mountains in singapore
um but usually it's- there will be people outside on uh bukit timah hill
hm uh maybe like uh some of our uh beach front area
you can see the beautiful scenery
alright
it's very uh- and it's not crowded
okay
let me just show you the tanglin mall
okay this is the tanglin mall
alright
so this is actually one of the street scene along the orchard uh- or tanglin shopping centre area
oh yah
uh well it depends on where you want to stay
so you can always have- give her uh a pamper you know
yes grand park they do have this service as well
um otherwise you can have your- this uh spa treatment in another hotel like for example hyatt uh fairmont hotel
so what you can do is we have this uh very interesting- or i would say uh dinner place in the botanical garden
then you can have your dinner here
so you could do this option
so ah- so again very relaxing
no problem
then in that case you just get out of the traders hotel
uh so you may have to take a taxi
of course western again um-
this is chicken rice
this is satay
uh and of course if you buy them from the chinese store
uh would be onions and cucumber
you'll be dining along the marina bay with the merlion in the background
so maybe not so conducive if you are talking about um- later on you're going to do a proposal
um and if you again don't want to go too far away you can just walk back on the uh one fullerton
but at least you can always have the crab at the one fullerton
esplanade theatres by the bay
so you could do a little bit of the uh what do you called that
okay
now uh this street is called haji lane
if you know you are not into shopping
so she likes some quirky fashion you know not the run of the mill fashion
it's a water pipe
uh it's accessible from the mrt or the buses
yes that's right
okay
so let see-
uh from this kind of shop they concord their own perfume
this is arab street
and in fact a lot of the shop owners here are third generation arabs
so you will get to see the other ethnic area uh in little india
that actually looks like a spaceship
okay
you know if you compare the old- new architecture the old architecture
yes you can do that
um and that's how singapore get rich in the early days
and these boats in the past used to ferry goods
i would suggest that in the morning you walk around the uh padang area
okay
yes it's a little bit uh sweet
alright
just on the tram ride itself without stopping
you would actually need more time here
but uh if you have just two days um- yes this is uh maybe something that i would be able to recommend you
well after a nice holiday i'm sure she will remember
uh and they will nibble away all your dead skin
yah
so you get this uh well spa
thanks very much for calling us
okay
okay
alright um
hi i'm- good afternoon
okay
yes
uh this is more personal
it's easier
and it's not all the way subterranean
so when you switch you just get off your train
later you tell me what are the other attractions that you like to visit what is the-
uh huh
from your hotel it depends if you're going during peak hours in the morning there's a surcharge
it's a fine day in singapore
i'm trying to find the price of this for you
uh let me see huh
eleventh yes
so it's a non-weekend uh timing so you are more likely to get
'cause you're a visitor
we had the timings earlier right
uh what do you mean uh like a motel
can you see here
let me have a look
oh so it is decorated in traditional style uh with uh with traditional porcelain ware and there on the side you have tourist brochures that you can pick-up
this is a traditional set of uh tables that we used to have in our kitchen
they're very small
three to four-star hotel
this is larger-
okay i know you now that you like modern hotels huh
they have a good buffet spread
it doesn't say here
yes you go that website
okay
oh you drop off at city hall station and you take bus number one nine five
uh our golf courses are separates uh usually
yes it does look like a durian
and places where you can have a drink or a meal
so maybe ten fifteen minutes inside and outside to photograph it
i think fifteen minutes with you stopping to take photographs
and if you are energetic you can walk all the way home to your hotel
well he can play golf you know
yes there are restaurants uh nearby at- because there's a big hotel called the fullerton hotel and they own the place in front of the hotel by the river- oh sorry by the bay
yes there are restaurants uh nearby at- because there's a big hotel called the fullerton hotel and they own the place in front of the hotel by the river- oh sorry by the bay
yes it's very nice
uh shopping malls not really expensive uh in the sense that the shopping malls have a mix of expensive as well as not so expensive uh items
so there is uh or i don't know whether you can call it a museum but when you enter it gives you the history of singapore in fact and the development along the rivers
and that's how we are able to close it off
yes it's free
and your- your golf is a hundred and fifteen so you have to take that off
okay we got the menu for you here and should have a price there
so from where you are looking at it sometimes it looks like it's floating
yes bistro moderne i'm not sure
okay
okay you want to go to the beach
okay let me uh show you-
yes
no they are attractions of sentosa
yes that is right
yes and you notice there's also a fort there
because dolphins are very friendly but we don't want them to be you know uh too long with humans
it's an open zoo next to a reservoir
but at the singapore zoo you can you know produce a photograph as though you are seeing the animal out in the wild
uh and let me get to the bird park first okay
yes
so here you walk in and you can see the birds feeding
and these feeding trace are very near the path where you walk and the birds are- they are used to tourist and locals feeding up-
yes that's right
okay when you carry the cup and the birds fly in and take it off the cup
yes in this aviary they are fed live worms
and all around you are fruit trees and trees that the birds feed on
it's a very quiet place
yah it's like um maybe two floors you know you're climbing two floors instead of taking the lift
yah it's like um maybe two floors you know you're climbing two floors instead of taking the lift
if you are a young child they will not select you
no she is a park uh staff
i know her
so i think uh instead of paying a model to model for this she did it but uh there are many people who are very happy to go up on stage and uh take photographs uh with the birds
some of the birds fly up the trees and they just don't come down
can i show you the other locations
uh no you just watch them
because those animals are very difficult to train
probably to dig the tunnel and also to get food
yes
yes for- that's for children um of up to a certain uh heights
and someone will lead them on the path
bananas uh durian
so-
uh yes there are crocodiles
yes because they have to prepare the environment
skulls of animals
yah i um- we want to encourage singaporeans to be conservation conscious
have you heard about it before
okay because it is a zoo that shows nocturnal animals
uh they were bred in the zoo and we have quite a few of them
and you see this couple
it uh has been breeding successfully
there wo~ when they ask for volunteers you need to-
okay
and we have a
they are not real cliffs but we re-create the environment yah
okay i think this is the gar
but if you pay forty two that means only ten dollars more you'll get the bird park as well
okay so yah i'm right twent- uh eighteen dollars
uh no it doesn't- you- the aviary is free but if you want to take the panorail ride around the park it's another five dollars
yes five dollars
uh yes
you're only staying one night so we have uh lots of hotel
there are four hotels manage by the group
you are near to attractions and you like i said you could visit the underwater world
uh yah what are your dates
let say two thirty times two uh four hundred and sixty dollars
yes a minimum of two nights
yes
three dollars to enter sentosa
thank you
uh can i know um what are your preferences
uh you want to stay in places where's there is greenery uh garden setting is it
uh actually travel is by distance
and the lrt you saw on the map is a light rail to support it
okay
so that's what you need to do
and you can do that to because i think two dollars is the very uh small fee to pay right
so in chinatown you get more uh chinese food souvenirs
uh in little india you can have a big variety of indian food uh and you can visit a lot of hindu temples
uh we also have very good class boutique hotels in chinatown
uh we have also new bridge road which is also along the main road uh santa grand hundred and forty eight
and santa grand has two hotels one they call it chinatown hundred and forty eight and lai chun yuen which is hundred and forty five
uh we also have a new majestic that's three hundred so we forget about that right
uh quieter side of chinatown is keong saik street
let me see
is it the same set of prices
uh thirty first of march the price is one eight
but uh there is no breakfast you ha~ eh it's not a problem with breakfast because you can always uh just walk out as i said
let me show you some uh pictures and images of the hotel
uh let me show you the picture here
and we also like sugar on the toast
and what we do is we take it with dark uh soy sauce
so you have it's like a desert you know what i mean
uh because it's a chain
the family has uh opened up many outlets all over-
so you can always budget accordingly
so it's on a popular beach with many attractions
can you see up here
so let me try and find it for you
the two hundred over dollars a night would be i think a hotel room
yes okay
to ba~ if you pick uh a weekday i think you'll definitely get a room
sorry i looked at it okay
kampong hut forty nine dollars i'm not sure
and also some people uh they like to have the sea breezes
so if you have air conditioning you are actually shutting out the natural environment
yes so uh for me because i like to go to as natural setting as possible so uh the kampong hut would be very attractive for me
the sea is very uh calm it's a sheltered bay
they didn't mention air conditioning
so some people on tight budget that's what they'll do
yes that is right
so what is your preference
was it eleventh
uh that's okay
so we forget about little india and chinatown
what sort of things that would you like to see whilst you're here
oh yes uh we have a botanic gardens that is very well-known
and sentosa also has greenery all around
it's the singapore botanic gardens
so ginger's uh consist of eight families and some of them uh they are grown for ornamental reasons
so we don't have a band playing there now because it's too small
but here you can see some of the attractions
you just have to pay to see the orchids
yes uh and you can go for romantic walk you know if you had bought your boyfriend along
maybe when you're walking you'll meet some ha~ a lot of handsome guys you know that live near the area
uh to this area
then you can carry on and uh further down the walk would be the orchid enclosure as well as the uh ginger orchids
we have some sculptures and we have huge uh heritage trees
can you see here this one called ceiba pentandra
and we also have useful gingers uh turmeric uh the normal ginger that you eat
and it's a three-hectare site you need about forty five minutes to visit the orchids alone to enjoy
to take pho~ oh yes so uh it's because there's- it's so interesting here i think three quarters or an hour is the minimum to enjoy this
the forest is just nearby
it's also very chea~
let me try
oh bukit timah is not
uh it's a further walk down to another section of the gardens and we have another lake there
because originally when the british came the gardens was used to experiment to see which spice trees what useful plants could be grown here
yes uh the best-
yah
zoos okay we try and get the zoo for you
and if you are tired you don't want to walk you can take uh panorail which is an air-conditioned train within the park
okay
okay so the restaurant you saw is air-conditioned if you are too hot you can go in and eat
uh but- yes i know
so after breakfast you'll be invited to take photos with the orangutan
okay
yes no cobra sorry
but you know this size especially if they do say wind themselves around your hand the keeper will be there to remove it
asian elephants who do a show and you can feed you just pay a few dollars for the food okay
so he has air-conditioned surroundings yah
alright bye
hello good afternoon
that's very wise because if you take public transports um some of the roads are closed off because it is uh what you call it
and it's you know the public transport will also not be uh passing by because i think they will not be allowed there because the road leads uh into the race track area
yes that's uh it's very sensible because it is uh- you know in the same location as parkroyal and of course raffles hotel is eight hundred dollars that's a five-star
uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it's near impossible it will be fully booked already
and you only want one room right
yah
they are places- i don't see the key here
your hotel is where this little uh like uh exclamation mark is
yah
yah
yes
i'll show you the location of it
uh-
you have-
uh singapore sling is a cocktail that was concocted at the raffles hotel
yah
we'll try and cancel this
yah that's-
we have got uh- this level one is about the area where the flyer is
you can even buy the glass to bring home
yes
uh yes that would be very easy
you will not be in the business area when you take this bus that connects you uh from the uh train station to the bu~
it's a very lovely setting for photography
they have multiplied a lot and don't be afraid if they come at you
so have you seen polar bears before
uh you will be able to because in the primate kingdom again it's open but uh the animals are in separate islands so that the species do not mix
so over the years they have decided that well this is my house and i'm happy i won't leave it because they have uh free lodging free medical facilities
you're not going to kidzworld so i will skip that
but there is also an area where you can see snakes
if not you can walk in the same area after you get off the tram and then you can uh walk and position yourself
and it was found years ago in india
and then when the offspring came out you know maybe half white half yellow they- it- they continue to breed until they got the white gene being uh predominant
besides the orang-utans these are very popular with uh tourists
yah so your camera- you don't forget your camera you'll be enjoying
this zoo you have to take a train it's a little bit further away okay
uh lots of places to amuse you
so it's a suspended roller coaster goes up around and upside down
uh that's really fun huh
uh that- yes
bags and shirt you can get in chinatown uh easily
and- so if you- at city hall you can take- let me see what's the easiest connection well either way
so that's where you can get a variety of uh things to buy
uh phones or tablets- phones you probably can buy- i can't tell you exactly the shops but i think i've seen phone shops there
you sound like a strong young man right
that's why i say it's in fact walkable uh because then you can take in the sights along the way
so as you walk you get to see more uh uh than you would if you uh hop up a bus
um hm
oh yes the best pair of sneakers that you have uh so- you know you are comfortable
so it's a fragrant jam that we put inside it's called kaya toast
and if you like it you can buy it home as a souvenir also
and ya kun here is a very old uh shop with a long history and now they have opened little cafés all over singapore
it's very affordable
uh they do it perfectly
and it's perfectly done really perfectly done
if you like pork- do you like pork
yes
okay
yah i'm the tour gui~
yes an i~ yes it's an island part of singapore mainly for tourist attraction
uh yah
yes
now the-
yah
so- and the hour of operation is also at here
right
uh universal studio if uh for the ticket wise if i'm not wrong uh we can get it from here right and yah
the adult price is seventy four the child is fifty four
yes senior citizen will be allowed
so in april you can see this uh the calendar here
yah
you see you can see from the map here
now you are asking me about the hotel uh hotel eighty one along orchard road
yes we do have restaurants
you can see on your screen itself you can see chilli crab which is one of our uh favourite dishes here in singapore
yes
we do have three restaurants which are there
we- if you can't finish it up you probably can ask for the smaller one which is about one or two scoops yah
yah
yah
east coast beach if the nearest the next one will be singapore flyer
uh let me just give you uh the map inside universal studio
this one is actually the-
yes you can find yah
no not for fishing
this one
you can probably also can take some nice photograph of the globe
uh cable car is uh just hang on huh
now four d means that there's a four- there are four different kind of effects you will get
one of them is the spects that you could wear it have a three dimension effect then uh the last one is the lights and the bumpy uh movement of the movie
you're welcome
which one
desperado
it's actually-
usually most of the tourist come they will not miss out sentosa
or if you want you can probably try this one
they will let you have a nice experience in the underwater world
we do have an interaction pool inside the underwater world where visitors can actually put their hands in uh to touch the fish
yes it is
uh there's a feeding session
you're most welcome
have a good day
hi good afternoon
do you like cars
so you're not fond of car racing cars
and in- uh from- you have a computer right
it's actually loated near to the station two train system station which is there
one is the little india station which we have the ne seven
you can see this serangoon road
if you see from the hotel the blue in colour
in fact the policeman is out twenty four hours looking at every one of us
and of course uh albert street here you can see albert street right
right
yah
six yah twelve dollar
this train is only accessible from the vivocity itself
now vivocity is up here as you can see um this is the screen of the vivocity
hm oh i- are you looking at the same page i'm looking at
uh inclu- i'm sorry that is a budget hotel so no breakfast is included
sometime you can also get noodles and also if you like to try our indian style of breakfast we call it roti prata which is made up of flour
you can try this um near to your hotel and it's quite cheap also
uh need not to worry you will not die on hunger
so sometime when your friends tell you- say that there are certain things that you should not do in singapore where one of them is smoking
so that was the reason why we have restrict them from smoking in the public area
so if you use english as um the communication language there shouldn't be a any problem even from getting from one place to another most of the places are written in english it is quite easy to understand
yes we do have a safari here in singapore the most popular one is we call it the night safari
the night safari in fact is something like a night zoo and it's coming up on your screen right now
so since you are staying at little india the nearest place to pick up will be at hotel rendezvous
hotel rendezvous
or otherwise you can also pick up the uh train system uh from there
but usually if you go to night safari we usually goes around about five thirty or five pm because night safari is open at seven but uh when the drive bus journey takes you there it will be just nice for you to get around to take some nice photograph before the night safari opens up the gates uh for you to view
it's actually free of charge
so the train fare approximately i sup~ going to be around about two dollars per person
we use that to symbolise singapore
you can either go by three ways the mrt which is the circle line which i have told you about just now
there are- these buses here you can see via bukit timah
i guess your daughter and you will be enjoying the photography session inside the national orchid garden
it will give you the refund of the deposit of the ticket itself
we- yes this is the international airport
yes i will suggest you to get it done uh from the internet itself because um only when confirmation are there then they will give you the room
yes correct
thank you
hi good morning
uh firstly can i know when will you be travelling to singapore
okay usually uh you plan to travel by- the means of public transport; like the train and the buses
um usually in singapore we only use singapore currency
no problem i'll assist you out
you like to visit some of the attraction or theme park or you prefer to see some nature or you prefer to do a little bit of shopping on electronics or you buy something to give back home for your families
in fact there i will have to consider eh your needs so that i can place you at the right hotel where you will save up on transportation cost and also um for food wise where can you pick it up uh as well
alright now can you-
alright
so that means that in the early morning instead of getting your breakfast in the hotel uh which is hm uh which they don't serve uh breakfast you can pick it up at the next door where the coffee shop is
if you are staying for two-night you probably pay around about two hundred and twenty dollars at the most
yah just the stay
yah
yes located in the city area where uh most of the public transports are available
you also have the cc one which is circle line train system
because if you are looking at swimming then you have to have a full-fledged hotel or something like a three-star or four-star hotel
yah
oh i think wait huh
it's a twin bed there or you can also request for a king size bed or queen size bed
yes the hotel rooms are air conditioner
one is a northeast line the other one is the east-west bound train uh line and that's it
yes it's for the lodging
yes it's for the lodging
you can see on this part of the area you'll find that um serangoon road
yah ye- the ne seven in the serangoon road uh which is here
they pre~ uh they made those things and then they bring back to singapore and sell it here
uh so uh the next one that i'm gonna tell you is about a theme park which is uh also accessible uh by train to this theme park
then to hop a few places whereby you kinda physically enjoy it
so-

then- approximately about ten minutes from here huh
yah from the vivo station there is a sentosa express which eh will lead you into universal studio
eh yes of course
yah
yes correct
yes yap in total it's about yah
yah
well of course uh if you choose too um uh okay
it doesn't apply to the admission to the attraction called universal studio

this is the only water rides available here
uh the lost world if you ha- have you watch the movie called jurassic park
uh part of the show um not the full complete show of the water world
uh you know the um the mine coaster
because the universal studio have um lots of facilities inside the food court
so you see how wonderful he is uh and he is been conducted inside the theatre itself
then the last part will be the uh far far away which is- if you have watch th- cartoon movie called the shrek movie this is one part the movie which they make into three d's and it's a ride inside the um uh four d theatre itself
i would say
uh but no more rides are there
so this is the time table for the resort world
so if you were to take the train again it's free because you had already get paid for the admission into the sentosa island
okay so that is uh for the first day yah
and of course um this mall is also very popular uh for uh the vi~ uh for the tourist
