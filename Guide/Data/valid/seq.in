um this is participant one how are you ***next*** yes ***next*** okay i'm fine ***next*** are you feeling great this morning ***next*** 
uh i'm actually uh planning um a trip ***next*** uh to singapore ***next*** and i was wondering if you could actually help me out lynnette ***next*** great ***next*** 
uh on august ***next*** alright ***next*** uh and i'm planning to take with me my husband and my son ***next*** alright ***next*** 
and has any of your friends or relatives came to singapore before ***next*** uh yes i've had a couple of uh friends or officemates who actually you know who've been to singapore before ***next*** but i haven't gotten really much um information from them ***next*** okay you will be arriving at singapore ***next*** 
okay ***next*** alright ***next*** okay so uh what are your son like ***next*** any theme park or what is he like ***next*** 
so again it depends on your budget ***next*** it's like one straight road ***next*** okay ***next*** and that's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there ***next*** 
uh i was ***next*** okay ***next*** uh so i was thinking also maybe uh since you have only one day in singapore ***next*** you could also try taking the subway uh to your hotel which we call it the mrt ***next*** 
uh on this train it's actually uh eastwest line ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so this is um from the east you'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station ***next*** 
so this is um from the east you'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station ***next*** okay ***next*** so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day ***next*** i would recommend that you stay in the uh city hall ***next*** 
because i think that's much cheaper if uh compared to riding a taxi correct ***next*** yes ***next*** because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about ***next*** again depending on the timing that you have arrive ***next*** 
again depending on the timing that you have arrive ***next*** uh in the region of let's say forty dollars ***next*** singapore dollars ***next*** so all the prices i'm quoting you will be in singapore dollars ***next*** 
let's say three dollars ***next*** but because if you are buying a standard card there is actually a dollar deposit ***next*** okay ***next*** so let's say if the taxi ***next*** 
got it ***next*** thank you ***next*** yah ***next*** and if you are spending let's say money in the uh shopping centre ***next*** 
yes ***next*** and then yah leave on the twenty seventh ***next*** i think that's much better ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh so they do have uh quite a lot of family staying in this hotel as well ***next*** okay good ***next*** uh yah ***next*** 
because again you can take the subway ***next*** so what you do is ***next*** okay let's say we skip the arrival part right ***next*** i mean that's done right ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so you can try that ***next*** and they have another dish called murtabak ***next*** it has all kind of fillings in there; chicken ***next*** 
uh beef uh even sardine ***next*** alright ***next*** and ***next*** they pan fry it ***next*** 
this is something very local as well ***next*** alright ***next*** yes so you can have that ***next*** and then you just walk towards the subway ***next*** 
alright ***next*** yes so you can have that ***next*** and then you just walk towards the subway ***next*** uh which will be the bugis mrt ***next*** 
so we would be able to uh communicate with them okay ***next*** okay ***next*** yes no problem ***next*** uh majority of us here speaks english ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so once you get down to the mrt uh you will be able to see uh the map ***next*** okay i have opened up the uh mrt lines for you to see ***next*** would you be able ***next*** 
would you be able ***next*** do you ***next*** were you ***next*** are you able to copy that ***next*** 
so can you follow towards your lefthand side ***next*** okay ***next*** my left hand ***next*** uh to the left ***next*** 
to the left ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** and then you will see city hall ***next*** 
okay ***next*** or alternatively there is another hotel which is very convenient just lavender ***next*** lavender ***next*** yes just before bugis ***next*** 
v ***next*** alright v hotel ***next*** yeah ***next*** yah ***next*** 
uh just outside your hotel there are lots of eating places ***next*** and you can get a breakfast for uh ***next*** there's a food court ***next*** a food court is an airconditioned uh it's a modern version of the non airconditioned hawker centres ***next*** 
okay can you see city hall ***next*** and then you go up ***next*** up alright ***next*** yah ***next*** 
oh the purple line ***next*** yah ***next*** okay ***next*** purple line ***next*** 
yah harbourfront ***next*** harbourfront ***next*** yah ***next*** so you will alight at harbourfront ***next*** 
like a five dollars kind of and a two dollars and some coins ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** there is change given but they accept the smaller notes ***next*** 
okay ***next*** you can get by using the buses on sentosa ***next*** uh and the buses that operates on sentosa were ***next*** uh they are free ***next*** 
okay and on sentosa you see all these roads ***next*** okay ***next*** uh you can travel on the buses ***next*** sentosa buses ***next*** 
uh in the park and uh you can do a lot of attractions there ***next*** alright ***next*** um so the ticket we have to buy it on the place itself ***next*** uh you can also buy uh online before you arrive ***next*** 
alright you can go to this place ***next*** uh again if you're going to stay in the lavender mrt area ***next*** uh it's just like two station away from where you are ***next*** um you go to funan centre ***next*** 
yes so what you ***next*** maybe they may not be able to give you like a lot of discount ***next*** uh but they can always give you freebies ***next*** because they know that if you go into the shop and you walked out ***next*** 
alright ***next*** and how's the price ***next*** um is it like um somewhat similar to um hong kong or you could say that it's actually much cheaper ***next*** it's different because the quality here uh is better i would say ***next*** 
and how's the price ***next*** um is it like um somewhat similar to um hong kong or you could say that it's actually much cheaper ***next*** it's different because the quality here uh is better i would say ***next*** it's not like the street kind of uh shopping ***next*** 
it's not like the street kind of uh shopping ***next*** they are shops ***next*** so the quality is good i would say ***next*** so it all depends ***next*** 
and on top of that you can always claim back the gst the goods and services tax ***next*** hm alright ***next*** which is like uh seven per cent ***next*** and it's so easy you know ***next*** 
you just produce the receipt that has been stamped ***next*** uh sorry ***next*** uh that is given by the retailer ***next*** and let's say if you are putting your purchases in your luggage ***next*** 
hm okay ***next*** alright ***next*** so if you are buying smaller items like uh jewellery watches ***next*** then you can have your uh gst refund um just before you board the plane ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so that's ***next*** thank you for giving me a lot of uh options ***next*** but then ***next*** 
yes ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** so um ***next*** 
well of course if you can spare five times that would be great but uh ***next*** yah it's no issue ***next*** i mean three days i could ***next*** we could still do everything that uh you would like to do and ***next*** 
i can see it ***next*** it's okay now ***next*** yes ***next*** okay ***next*** 
east oh this is the eastern part of singapore okay ***next*** east oh this is the eastern part of singapore okay ***next*** yes so you'll see a few colours right ***next*** so the green line will be the eastwest line ***next*** 
okay can you see the top ***next*** woodlands yes ***next*** i can see the woodlands ***next*** uh okay ***next*** 
i can see the woodlands ***next*** uh okay ***next*** and then down will be number ten ***next*** can you see number ten ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay so let say you're going there ***next*** so what you do is you go to the train station ***next*** and you will press paya lebar and the machine will tell you how much is the cost ***next*** 
um actually not yet ***next*** so do you think you can suggest some where we could stay ***next*** hm alright ***next*** there are quite a number of uh hotels that you can stay uh the ***next*** 
so do you think you can suggest some where we could stay ***next*** hm alright ***next*** there are quite a number of uh hotels that you can stay uh the ***next*** i guess you don't really mind like uh budget hotels ***next*** 
and from there it's just about seven to ten minutes' walk to the hotel ***next*** oh okay ***next*** that's great ***next*** so and ***next*** 
okay ***next*** again it's just walk alright ***next*** just across from your hotel you can spend easily you know ***next*** two hours i would say minimum one hour in the museum ***next*** 
yes yes ***next*** alright in the hotel itself so you can do that ***next*** oh so they have that already in the hotel ***next*** yah they have a sauna and a fitness centre ***next*** 
and one of our local food that uh a lot of the local likes to do in the morning ***next*** is we have what we called the kaya toast with coffee ***next*** kaya toast ***next*** kaya toast yah ***next*** 
and then you can go over to do your museums ***next*** yah ***next*** alright ***next*** and i would definitely also recommend going to sentosa island ***next*** 
okay so this is something that you saw on the screen ***next*** oh you have zipline there ***next*** oh she'll definitely love that ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yah i think she'll be interested with the parajump ***next*** she likes heights ***next*** yah ***next*** and then we have the climbmax as well ***next*** 
you can do ***next*** so you can separate ***next*** you can ***next*** some of them wants to do the adventure go to the adventure ***next*** 
um yes ***next*** alright ***next*** so you can see ***next*** uh you can do this ***next*** 
alright and that would be at the underwater world ***next*** oh underwater world ***next*** so what you do in the underwater world you go inside ***next*** it's located like uh below the ground area ***next*** 
oh that's great ***next*** and they also have a dolphin show out there ***next*** um yah ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah for weekend it will be about seventy two dollars ***next*** just a few dollars more ***next*** alright ***next*** 
so uh that's universal studio ***next*** of course lots of things to do there all the interesting ride ***next*** like uh madagascar and they have this transformer ride ***next*** i think that's thrilling as well ***next*** 
uh i would say to four hours minimum ***next*** four hours okay ***next*** yah ***next*** because if you want to do some of the rides you know and the show ***next*** 
yes ***next*** so that's something you can do and let's say in the evening ***next*** uh huh in the evening ***next*** evening you can do uh ***next*** 
and some of our other local food will be like um uh fried hokkien noodles ***next*** yah noodles ***next*** yah ***next*** yah prawn noodles ***next*** 
really ***next*** yah ***next*** so we eat with our hands in the restaurants ***next*** yes ***next*** 
to wash the hands ***next*** yah ***next*** we might take it as a juice ***next*** yah ***next*** 
you can do that as well ***next*** and then the first day maybe do it take it easier ***next*** you do a little bit of museum ***next*** do a bit of shopping around your hotel area ***next*** 
yes ***next*** yes ***next*** yes ***next*** uh there's a shopping mall called city hall ***next*** 
okay that's great ***next*** yah in city hall there is shopping centre called raffles city ***next*** raffles city ***next*** raffles city ***next*** 
oh i see ***next*** yah ***next*** so again you have luxury brand to uh midrange to local brands ***next*** and it's also fun to just do people watching out there on orchard road ***next*** 
so what ***next*** yah t o a ***next*** t o a ***next*** p a y o h ***next*** 
uh you can visit our ***next*** just walk around uh ***next*** okay you just walk around ***next*** it's quite interesting because you're right in the heart of our residential area ***next*** 
yah so uh that's something you can do ***next*** alright so you just need ***next*** alright so you just need ***next*** it's a small gallery about twenty minutes is sufficient ***next*** 
yes ***next*** yah ***next*** we'll do that ***next*** alright ***next*** 
yes ***next*** so aside from the one at the hotel ***next*** uh there are also lot of spas um near the hotel ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** right ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** 
the plants is it ***next*** yes ***next*** no we do have ***next*** but uh actually the highlight of the botanical gardens would be uh the orchids ***next*** 
oh shows ***next*** yah ***next*** so what do they do in these shows ***next*** it all depends ***next*** 
so it all depends on what is available ***next*** what is uh planned for that particular sunday ***next*** and you can always pack your picnic basket with wine ***next*** and just sit and with your mat alright ***next*** 
we can see um ***next*** um we can go shopping here also and dine ***next*** so this is an old building right ***next*** yah these are all old building which has been restored ***next*** 
and when ***next*** you see in the past when you open up fully ***next*** you can get more ventilation into the house ***next*** and right in the centre there's actually an air well ***next*** 
but it's just above the green roof on the first level ***next*** there are usually some engravings out there ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
you can have a chinese tea appreciation in chinatown as well ***next*** okay ***next*** so do spend about one hour if you plan to have your chinese tea appreciation ***next*** with some uh socalled small bites you know like titbits kind of uh thing ***next*** 
yah it is a small cup ***next*** so it's actually appreciation ***next*** so you smell it first and then you sip slowly ***next*** and meanwhile you know you sort of uh chit chat with your friends ***next*** 
but at the same time we want something um which is a bit historical ***next*** wherein we can learn something about your culture your traits ***next*** and you know different places wherein we can remember singapore at all times ***next*** okay ***next*** 
or you can buy the tourist ticket ***next*** okay is there any price difference between those tickets ***next*** oh okay it's just that the standard uh ***next*** the stored value ticket will be easier for you to travel around ***next*** 
to your ***next*** the places of interest ***next*** have you any idea which um the three of them is the best one ***next*** uh best ***next*** 
then i would say that the one closer to bras basah would be better ***next*** oh okay that's great ***next*** so i think and uh i'll be choosing that one ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes you just need to walk ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** so what you do is you just walk ***next*** 
from the early nine hundreds to modern day singapore ***next*** oh okay ***next*** cool yah ***next*** hm you can use the audio guide ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** cool yah ***next*** hm you can use the audio guide ***next*** we have ***next*** 
okay ***next*** now after this so you can do this in the morning ***next*** yah ***next*** okay have your lunch in our many hawker centre ***next*** 
okay they have various kinds of food ***next*** like chinese food indian food malay food and we even have fish and chips out in our hawker centre ***next*** oh cool ***next*** now one meal uh will cost you with drinks in the range of eight singapore dollars ***next*** 
chinatown okay ***next*** what can i see in chinatown ***next*** yah ***next*** okay because you would have a good idea of the history of singapore ***next*** 
but eventually it gets crowded so the uh they moved away from this area ***next*** okay ***next*** so the chinese stayed back in chinatown ***next*** then the malays moved to this area called kampong glam ***next*** 
yah because in the old days their houses were not air conditioned ***next*** alright ***next*** so uh you can actually see uh uh ***next*** okay that's another view of chinatown ***next*** 
oh yes ***next*** it's a chinese temple ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes ***next*** in all our mrt train station there's always a station master ***next*** so uh you just approach uh the station master and anyway the signs are all quite clear ***next*** so just alight ***next*** 
it's not a games arcade ***next*** it's just socalled the little india arcade ***next*** okay then you can do a walk because it's ***next*** the whole atmosphere is totally different from chinatown ***next*** 
uh because the indians uh like flowers because it represents the way of life ***next*** yes ***next*** and of course they use ***next*** uh they buy ***next*** 
what was that again ***next*** i'm sorry ***next*** vegetables ***next*** like a market but they are like stand alone shops ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yah ***next*** and ***next*** so uh take a walk around uh little india ***next*** 
and ***next*** so uh take a walk around uh little india ***next*** and uh soak in the atmosphere out there ***next*** the sari shop ***next*** 
yah ***next*** and you can also have this bread called naan ***next*** uh huh ***next*** or you can have chapati which is made from wheat flour ***next*** 
yes ***next*** yah ***next*** you can see uh ***next*** so that is the whole ***next*** 
can you see the word campbell lane ***next*** yup ***next*** okay ***next*** oh uh there is this ***next*** 
you know when you first apply it were ***next*** it's black in colour but it takes about half an hour to dry ***next*** when it starts to crack you will just scrape off ***next*** leave this orange uh a stain on your hands it probably last you about seven days ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** yah the artist are pretty good ***next*** they can just come out ***next*** they can draw for you within like uh ***next*** 
and you get about uh ***next*** okay i just want to show you some of the scene ***next*** in chinatown uh in little india this one here ***next*** okay ***next*** 
and the next one is food ***next*** do you like colourful food ***next*** yup ***next*** okay ***next*** 
uh okay ***next*** so i just need to request this from the salesman ***next*** yes ***next*** so instead of getting curry you ask for dhal ***next*** 
it's dhal ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** dhal yah ***next*** 
okay but ***next*** okay it's made up of yogurt ***next*** alright ***next*** uh but they have added in like the modern uh taste would be ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so a meal in uh food centre would cost you about ***next*** with the uh lassi ***next*** about eight dollars ***next*** 
so like some of the other souvenirs that you may want to pick up in little india would be like bangles ***next*** you can buy bangles for a dollar each ***next*** for a dollar of uh ***next*** a dollar for a few of these plastic bangles ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so there is a night market ***next*** okay ***next*** uh no night market in kampong glam but there are a lot of cafes ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay it's a mosque so uh again you have to be appropriately dressed ***next*** okay ***next*** for a visit to the mosque ***next*** 
okay ***next*** because um as i could see they have uh very um different architectural designs ***next*** oh okay ***next*** i would say subtle differences ***next*** 
you are actually seeing um a white house this used to be the sultan palace ***next*** but they are now undergoing uh restoration ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh the nicer beach will be on sentosa island ***next*** otherwise you ***next*** if you don't want we have a beach that ***next*** 
and the hotels ***next*** some of the hotels do offer spa ***next*** oh okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
but ***next*** oh okay ***next*** but um usually you uh what month do you celebrate your festivals ***next*** okay we have uh ***next*** 
somewhere in the eastern part of singapore ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** yah uh so basically it's one of these gods uh uh festival that's about it ***next*** 
so the chinese will offer food and offering uh to the gods ***next*** oh okay ***next*** so usually people just offer uh foods to the gods ***next*** food and offering ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** so usually people just offer uh foods to the gods ***next*** food and offering ***next*** yah that's right for the particular god's birthday ***next*** 
yah that's right for the particular god's birthday ***next*** okay that's the only activity for this uh day ***next*** uh if you are going to the temples in the eastern part of singapore then yes they are ***next*** it's quite uh festive ***next*** 
again people are selling food associated with the celebration of hari raya ***next*** uh people are buying new clothes ***next*** uh for the whole family to wear when they visit one another ***next*** uh deepavali quite similar to the other two festivals ***next*** 
is there ***next*** and how many days were you be spending here ***next*** i think um two to three days ***next*** okay ***next*** 
so uh what you can do is ***next*** because just now you also mentioned to uh look around singapore ***next*** yes ***next*** so what i will suggest is uh the first day you could do a little bit of sightseeing ***next*** 
so what i will suggest is uh the first day you could do a little bit of sightseeing ***next*** and uh also include either our zoo and night safari for first day ***next*** and second day sentosa ***next*** uh third day with a little bit of shopping um and relaxation ***next*** 
um by the way um i have uh one thousand singaporean dollars um budget for the tour ***next*** will that be uh sufficient for the two of us or we need to uh have additional budget ***next*** okay ***next*** uh i think it's quite fine with a thousand dollars ***next*** 
and actually if you go back to tanah merah ***next*** you go to the left you will see paya lebar ***next*** yes ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay ***next*** can you find ***next*** uh there's a intercross ***next*** 
looks interesting ***next*** yes ***next*** so basically you will be doing a tram ride ***next*** and on the tram ride you will be able to see more than seventy per cent of the ***next*** 
uh you'll be riding as in in the park you mean ***next*** yes in the park ***next*** yes on the tram ***next*** because uh the western loop of the night safari ***next*** 
okay ***next*** there is a stop at the uh leopard uh trail ***next*** so you could get off the leopard trail do a half an hour walk ***next*** and then come back to the same tram station ***next*** 
in the afternoon you could either do uh the zoo uh as well ***next*** because they are all ***next*** they are just located uh next door to one another ***next*** and you are looking at different animals ***next*** 
ah so you mean the zoo is different from the night safari ***next*** yes they are just next door to one another ***next*** so it's totally different ***next*** so you are seeing ***next*** 
uh i would say other drinks other than liquor ***next*** some traditional drinks uh bubble tea ***next*** where we can get from small bubble tea shops ***next*** uh the indian drink will be lassi ***next*** 
i guess we do have a lot of convenient stores ***next*** um the local chain would be like cheers c h e e r s ***next*** it's a small convenient store ***next*** okay otherwise uh every other uh let's say front of some shopping centres ***next*** 
that's why i'm asking ***next*** right ***next*** ah okay ***next*** it's um ***next*** 
that's how this street gets its name ***next*** uh so like some of the major shopping centre would be ***next*** um tangs studio tangs ***next*** uh ngee ann city which is a huge shopping complex ***next*** 
until uh the number forty two blue square ***next*** yah ***next*** all the way that's all orchard road ***next*** shopping ***next*** 
so uh the shopping hours in singapore ***next*** uh starts at ten o'clock finish at ***next*** ten am ***next*** ten am and finish at nine thirty ***next*** 
like um do you have ***next*** what are the popular um brands that i can um see in the shopping malls ***next*** because uh ***next*** well you have the ***next*** 
uh we have of course the luxury brands ***next*** uh gucci coach prada ***next*** they are located in most of these shopping centres ***next*** like number thirty twenty two ion we have them ***next*** 
okay ***next*** they are found in uh number twenty two that's ion ***next*** uh number twenty six okay ***next*** uh and also twenty three alright ***next*** 
uh the city hall right now is uh not used as a city hall anymore ***next*** we are uh refurbishing it ***next*** so we're renovating it and it's going to become one of our art gallery ***next*** uh what i will suggest is if you want to pay a visit to our ura ***next*** 
in fact uh the whole history of singapore ***next*** i think i will put that um on my list ***next*** of places to visit ***next*** yes ***next*** 
uh and the chinatown area together ***next*** is it on same area ***next*** uh the ura urban redevelopment authority ***next*** it's the same area as chinatown ***next*** 
it's the same area as chinatown ***next*** uh okay ***next*** the national museum will be closer to the supreme court ***next*** because you mentioned that you wanted to do some singapore uh uh offices right ***next*** 
you can actually walk in um even for a ten minutes if you just want to sitin ***next*** and you can just give ***next*** really ***next*** yes ***next*** 
but are we allowed to sitin ***next*** in like for if there is an ongoing trial ***next*** and are we allowed to sitin on the proceeding ***next*** yes you are allowed to ***next*** 
yes you are allowed to ***next*** like i mentioned you just have to go through security ***next*** before you enter into the court ***next*** uh before you enter into the supreme court ***next*** 
national park ***next*** yah ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
uh it's three hundred and eighty six uh metres tall ***next*** like um how many how many floors of a building ***next*** how many floor ***next*** approximately about uh sixty ***next*** 
that's a bit um high sixty to seventy ***next*** a bit high ***next*** oh but you are not going to climb steps ***next*** it's like uh a slope going up the hill and uh ***next*** 
uh starting from uh ***next*** just beginning of orchard road uh at the junction of scotts road ***next*** we have like hyatt hotel marriott hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** 
that we can stay just for one day ***next*** alright ***next*** okay there are quite a number of hotels uh what you mentioned ***next*** uh there is like uh fullerton bay hotel ***next*** 
uh this is like uh landmark building ***next*** uh it faces the marina bay so you get a good uh view ***next*** and of course remember to ask for the bay view side of the hotel okay ***next*** uh and around the bay you have other hotels like um ***next*** 
okay ***next*** east village ***next*** yes ***next*** okay that's a bit far off ***next*** 
okay that's a bit far off ***next*** on east coast ***next*** yah it's a little bit far off ***next*** uh okay maybe i can also recommend you this hotel ***next*** 
ling ***next*** link l i n k ***next*** oh link ***next*** link hotel ***next*** 
or uh ***next*** that's a threestar hotel ***next*** we move down it's oxford hotel ***next*** it's also a good location uh but they don't have facilities like the spa ***next*** 
yes so you ***next*** so it's like a bicycle ***next*** uh i wouldn't say it's like a bicycle you don't ride you know ***next*** you basically press on like uh accelerator ***next*** 
okay i will show you what the luge is like ***next*** okay ***next*** can you show me one ***next*** yah um ***next*** 
this one you will have to pay extra uh ***next*** okay there are different uh admission prices ***next*** so let's say if you want to do uh the two ***next*** uh the luge alright ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so it's quite great fun uh doing the luge ***next*** the prices for just one luge and one skyride ***next*** will be twelve dollars and fifty cents per person ***next*** 
i'm uh participant number six ***next*** i'm catherine ***next*** how are you ***next*** okay i'm fine catherine ***next*** 
oh really ***next*** that's really nice ***next*** yes nice warm weather ***next*** and uh ***next*** 
uh just take note there is a deposit of one dollar ***next*** so when you exit from your destination ***next*** remember to take back your ***next*** uh one dollar deposit ***next*** 
uh you will receive a card that looks like a credit card ***next*** that size ***next*** okay once you get the card you proceed to the um entrance to the station ***next*** just tap your card ***next*** 
unless you planning to change hotel every night ***next*** otherwise yah ***next*** so you take the mrt for sightseeing uh ***next*** i'm showing this uh mrt map for you get a feel of the different ***next*** 
every other hotel or building ***next*** it's either a hotel ***next*** or a shopping mall ***next*** right ***next*** 
ci~ ***next*** where is that ***next*** ah okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
is that five minutes along ***next*** five minutes from the city hall ***next*** okay five minutes to the padang area it's a shady spot ***next*** you can walk and then you will come to the merlion ***next*** 
there is actually a shop there ***next*** so if you want to pick up some uh souvenirs ***next*** like the merlion keychain and all that ***next*** you know you pick it up there then you board the mrt ***next*** 
and you will go down to the cha~ ***next*** uh tanjong pagar ***next*** tanjong pagar ***next*** yah ***next*** 
then ***next*** yah so i do understand you have uh chinatown in philippines right ***next*** yes correct ***next*** hm but it is a little bit different from what we have here ***next*** 
so i'm gonna show you the image of uh thian hock keng temple there ***next*** so right ***next*** it says that uh right now we are doing some restoration work to the temple ***next*** but it's one of our oldest chinese ***next*** 
the bamboos are a symbol of long life ***next*** correct ***next*** but they are not made by bamboo ***next*** they are made of tiles ***next*** 
and when you leave the temple ***next*** this picture shows you the main entrance of the temple ***next*** you turn to your righthand side ***next*** okay you walk about uh four hundred metres ***next*** 
um so uh do they have like a specialty in that um restaurant ***next*** uh it's not a restaurant ***next*** it's all little shop which is about uh a hundred metre kind of a shop ***next*** hundred square metre ***next*** 
uh this is our version of carrot cake ***next*** uh it's actually white radish ***next*** it's radish fried with uh flour and egg ***next*** and sometimes it looks a bit dark ***next*** 
i will definitely ***next*** uh as ***next*** definitely i would try that carrot cake ***next*** yah ***next*** 
alright ***next*** so uh and if you again want to visit another chinese temple ***next*** there is another chinese temple uh called the buddha relic temple ***next*** it's just inbetween sago street and sago lane ***next*** 
so in the night time you may just want to uh rest up for ***next*** uh rest for a little while ***next*** before you head out for dinner ***next*** okay ***next*** 
uh you can also do ***next*** uh there's also a tram ride that you can take ***next*** and then uh in the middle of the zoo you can alight and walk around ***next*** do a little bit of the uh attractions ***next*** 
it's beautiful it's like park you know ***next*** is ***next*** i'm showing you now uh just portion of the day zoo ***next*** and let's go to the night safari park ***next***

oh ***next*** yah we have beaches ***next*** we have beaches uh on the island ***next*** and we also have an island called sentosa that you can go to ***next*** 
and that is where we have maybe the better class hotels ***next*** uh it's also the business area ***next*** if you follow uh a little bit further out ***next*** you know where the green line hits the yellow and the red ***next*** 
affordable prices yes ***next*** this is chinatown ***next*** which i think is quite interesting ***next*** i will get you little india later if you want ***next*** 
which i think is quite interesting ***next*** i will get you little india later if you want ***next*** sure ***next*** but chinatown is uh you know you can walk out and buy things from the shops ***next*** 
that will be perfect so that we can spend our money um with food ***next*** we can buy more food and clothes ***next*** alright but anyway ***next*** yes ***next*** 
no ***next*** you don't need so much if you are using buses than train ***next*** oh perfect ***next*** yah ***next*** 
oh perfect ***next*** yah ***next*** the only thing is if you take the train ride round singapore um you have ***next*** and you get off say one stop from your hotel ***next*** 
can you suggest a restaurant ***next*** yes ***next*** uh you know where you are in chinatown ***next*** we have a very old market that has been spruced up ***next*** 
okay ***next*** now it's actually on the edge of the business district and chinatown ***next*** oops ***next*** and it would be within walking distance ***next*** 
and there are some open at dinner time and supper time ***next*** uh huh ***next*** wow ***next*** and we've got noodles we've got rice ***next*** 
wow that's great ***next*** uh actually i should tell you that uh your hotel is located in what uh maybe ***next*** eighty years ago was a red light district ***next*** but it's full stop now ***next*** 
at vivocity on the top floor you can get an express light rail system direct into sentosa ***next*** wow perfect ***next*** but the easier way is you just go to the foot the bus bay ***next*** because at the bus bay again you can get a lot of variety of food ***next*** 
but the easier way is you just go to the foot the bus bay ***next*** because at the bus bay again you can get a lot of variety of food ***next*** malay ***next*** this time you get more of the malay uh that means uh muslim food and indian food ***next*** 
actually the good thing is to get uh ***next*** what do you call it ***next*** get to the top of mount faber which is near to harbourfront ***next*** and uh buy or ***next*** 
okay ***next*** universal studios huh ***next*** wow resorts world ***next*** so if you stay there you would use up your thousand dollars very quickly ***next*** 
so if you went and took these rides then it would cost more ***next*** but ***next*** i think she's not really into casino so that's fine if ***next*** yah ***next*** 
but ***next*** i think she's not really into casino so that's fine if ***next*** yah ***next*** so yes that would save you a lot of money ***next*** 
i'm sorry ***next*** oh too bad ***next*** yah ***next*** uh they are built like the old style microphones that have the um the rounded tops ***next***

oh yes ***next*** so you know they have a little gadget for holding your ashes when you are smoking ***next*** uh i've seen a tourist used it ***next*** i thought it was very cute ***next*** 
it's just so that you don't break the antilittering law ***next*** right ***next*** although most of the time nobody gets caught ***next*** so uh singapore may not be as clean as you imagine it to be ***next*** 
bring extra money for shopping is it ***next*** right ***next*** uh there ***next*** you still have some time with me so if you want to ask anything else ***next*** 
alright ***next*** yah ***next*** we missed that ***next*** yes ***next*** 
i'm just curious how much do we need to pay if we'll drink ***next*** uh actually on a weekday ***next*** i'm not sure if it's tuesday or wednesday ***next*** some bars have a women's night ***next*** 
more for the you know if you go in the bars sometimes they're cold or the restaurants ***next*** or the air conditioning within uh certain areas ***next*** uh let me see here ***next*** okay ***next*** 
the outside area would not be hot ***next*** uh would not be cold ***next*** although uh these few months we had some cold evenings ***next*** which is very nice if you enjoy walking out in the open ***next*** 
so in the evening times many people go out and walk because they find it ***next*** well firstly if they work in day they have time only in the evenings ***next*** alright ***next*** yes so here you see a scene of the light up ***next*** 
wow ***next*** but at the time you come you can ***next*** we are now linking up the shops in orchard road so ***next*** um it's not hundred per cent connected but like maybe eighty per cent ***next***

uh for mother's day ***next*** yah and otherwise the next event will be in june ***next*** uh yah ***next*** because that would be the june school holidays in singapore ***next***

that's a very scenic area by the river ***next*** and you could walk around there and you ***next*** if you want the bus ***next*** you go down to clarke quay ***next*** 
uh and uh yes ***next*** so if you catch the bus on it's whole journey ***next*** you get to visit the other farms ***next*** but i think sungei buloh itself is enough to interest you ***next*** 
so that's the first place that i should go to ***next*** first thing in the morning ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** 
so um you could time yourself ***next*** so that when you come out of here ***next*** you could go to the bird park ***next*** so that if no birds waive at you at this park ***next***

which one is your favorite ***next*** which one do you like eating the best ***next*** which one do you really like ***next*** i like a very old one ***next*** 
i mean visit right ***next*** visit yes then you walk around ***next*** so if you're in little india you visit the little india area on foot ***next*** say in the morning ***next*** 
and along serangoon road which is the main road uh in little india ***next*** you have many vegetarian restaurants also ***next*** in fact it's a great place uh for vegetarians in little india ***next*** because many of the hindus here are vegetarian ***next*** 
uh once you pay for a cup of coffee you can get a whole uh vegetarian meal ***next*** in little india ***next*** or chinese noodles in chinatown you know like ***next*** three four dollars ***next*** 
or can you give us directions ***next*** are you guys approachable and friendly too ***next*** yes ***next*** but you have to do the approaching ***next*** 
they would be very helpful and if you get in to any train station uh the officers there would be very happy to direct you ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** i was supposed to show you the ***next*** 
how much is it ***next*** because uh what ***next*** you ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** what is this ***next*** why am i getting this ***next*** pictures ***next*** 
you see ***next*** okay ***next*** i think they tied up with a lot of people ***next*** uh with the ezlink card you can buy food as well ***next*** 
like that so ***next*** yes ***next*** to be able to enjoy it ***next*** at least five days i think ***next*** 
and my name is lynnette ***next*** and how may i address you ***next*** uh i'm participant number sixty ***next*** okay and would i be able to get your name ***next*** 
and the other beaches would be pahlawan ***next*** okay ***next*** okay that's pahlawan coming up ***next*** okay you can see they are beautiful right ***next*** 
wow ***next*** mild monsoon rains ***next*** okay and what month are those ***next*** um okay it's generally happening in uh the month of november ***next*** 
the beaches on sentosa ***next*** it's comparable to what famous beach around the world ***next*** uh i think we are very different ***next*** our beaches are i would say manmade alright ***next*** 
okay ***next*** lagoons okay alright ***next*** yes so it's safe to swim in the lagoons ***next*** and also in the lagoons itself you have these buoys ***next*** 
uh is the water in sentosa is it good for snorkelling also ***next*** uh no we ***next*** i would not recommend you to go snorkelling in sentosa ***next*** uh we normally do i would say scuba diving ***next*** 
um i'm guessing there is a fee for this right ***next*** how much is it ***next*** okay the admission into this merlion park is eight dollars for an adult ***next*** and five dollars for child ***next*** 
uh for one ride it could take about may be twenty to thirty ***next*** may be even to forty five minutes ***next*** just to get on the rides but it's not that bad here in uh universal studio singapore ***next*** yah that i would say may be saturday sunday yes you do have to queue a bit of time ***next*** 
just to get on the rides but it's not that bad here in uh universal studio singapore ***next*** yah that i would say may be saturday sunday yes you do have to queue a bit of time ***next*** uh maybe the more popular rides would be like transformer ***next*** yes maybe you do have to queue like fifty minutes over the weekends ***next*** 
if you ***next*** now you are looking at the uh ***next*** this is the back of the re~ ***next*** uh sentosa resort ***next*** 
now you are looking at the uh ***next*** this is the back of the re~ ***next*** uh sentosa resort ***next*** uh in the front area you ***next*** 
and i guess we can do uh ***next*** we can probably book hypothetically for august uh seventeen to eighteen ***next*** just to see if they have available rooms on that ***next*** yah let's see whether they have uh okay ***next*** 
and yes ***next*** and you can ***next*** you are actually looking at one of our uh newer shopping centre called ion on orchard road ***next*** if you look at the map below you see the pink highlighted area ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yes and what would ***next*** what does she likes to shop for ***next*** what do you think she will like to shop for ***next*** 
and i see here that uh we have pretty highend shops on orchard road uh right ***next*** uh are there any places here or roads where they have bargain like for shops or the market ***next*** uh we don't really call our shops market here ***next*** uh but just on the junction of this building uh ion ***next*** 
so if you just walk down uh you will come to this shopping mall called the um uh far east shopping centre ***next*** okay now this sell uh the i would say the budget and midrange kind of products ***next*** uh that ranges from hair accessories uh ear accessories right up to fashion and shoes ***next*** so that is one option that you may wanna consider ***next*** 
so that is one option that you may wanna consider ***next*** all these shops are just one shop so they don't really have chain shops ***next*** uh so it's not like the high fashion ***next*** uh the other place that i would like to recommend uh for the cheaper options of shopping ***next*** 
my son is more interested in science actually ***next*** okay ***next*** so i would be able to recommend he ***next*** uh you a science centre which a lot of school children they like to go to this uh place call the science centre ***next*** 
yah so ***next*** and uh most of the shops the locations and things to go to ***next*** it is accessible via the mrt is that right ***next*** yes ***next*** 
per trip ***next*** uh is there uh a ticket like an allday where i can use that ***next*** and i can go anywhere i want uh with that ticket no ***next*** uh we have like uh not the one day pass ***next*** 
per trip basis okay ***next*** yes ***next*** okay so yah ea~ ***next*** your earlier question like how much does it cost in science nine dollars uh for ***next*** 
yes ***next*** correct ***next*** so like for if you're spending the whole day on sentosa island uh or in universal studio ***next*** there are meals there are dining options available out there ***next*** 
oh is uh um are street food is available on sentosa island ***next*** uh yes we do have a food court uh located on sentosa island ***next*** uh for a meal with drink let's say a main course with a drink ***next*** that would cost you approximately about ten dollars ***next*** 
that would cost you approximately about ten dollars ***next*** okay ten dollars per person ***next*** per person ***next*** yah ten singapore dollars per person ***next*** 
yah ***next*** challenging okay eating with your hands would be like either the chili crabs or uh pepper crabs ***next*** this will be challenging ***next*** or if you really want something very exotic ***next*** 
at the satay club over at old uh lau pa sat ***next*** um hm okay and what's that ***next*** okay and that is ***next*** okay what is satay ***next*** 
of course try this food it is sold in either uh aircondition food centre ***next*** or nonairconditioned food centre ***next*** the nonaircondition uh food centre would be ***next*** the prices would be a little bit cheaper ***next*** 
yes our water here is very clean ***next*** so if you don't really have uh very weak stomach ***next*** we can actually drink directly from the tap ***next*** uh but of course again you are not so sure ***next*** 
yes hello ***next*** hello ***next*** hello good a~ ***next*** this is je~ ***next*** 
i haven't ***next*** may i ask your age group ***next*** are you twenty to thirty ***next*** thirty to forty ***next*** 
i'm not sure ***next*** which is really good ***next*** how much would that be ***next*** twi~ ***next*** 
you're looking at singapore river ***next*** and that's part of the theatres on the bay ***next*** uh huh ***next*** uh you can't quite see here ***next*** 
that's right ***next*** yes thanks ***next*** okay but um hm do you have pictures of the rooms in this hotel ***next*** pardon ***next***

yah ***next*** um hm ***next*** oh ***next*** bring your camera and take lots of photos ***next*** 
alright ***next*** uh when i get lost in there 'cause i'm pretty bad with directions ***next*** so ***next*** no you wouldn't get lost ***next*** 
so ***next*** so let me show you where you are ***next*** this is the map of the southern part of singapore ***next*** and if you ***next*** 
yes um hm ***next*** yah as ***next*** um hm yes ***next*** so you switch to the north line ***next*** 
oh alright ***next*** so if i get lost that would be okay too ***next*** oh um ***next*** yes that would be okay ***next*** 
oh i think so ***next*** uh i ***next*** it's sound familiar ***next*** yah steamed and it's actually got a bit of soup inside the dumpling ***next*** 
they also have it there ***next*** there's a place ***next*** there's a place called race course road in singapore ***next*** located where there used to be a real race course in the early days ***next*** 
uh huh ***next*** so we have the chinatown and then this one is little india ***next*** and~ ***next*** yes that is right ***next*** 
fish head curry ***next*** curry yah i've heard of curry ***next*** but not fish head curry ***next*** they got ***next*** 
it's also on the train ***next*** oh it's also on the train ***next*** oh great ***next*** yah the bugis is uh one of the stops of on the eastwest line ***next*** 
the people have ***next*** the malays have merely moved out to the eastern side ***next*** so this is like a major shopping area ***next*** there are offices there as well ***next*** 
but the~ ***next*** nobody knows ***next*** i mean not ***next*** very few people bother what is about ***next*** 
nobody knows ***next*** i mean not ***next*** very few people bother what is about ***next*** so you gotta look for bhg and it's at the bugis station ***next*** 
uh huh ***next*** theatres on the bay ***next*** what do they showcase there ***next*** there are two major theatres and smaller studios ***next*** 
yes then you go ***next*** uh we have good shows at marina bay sands ***next*** that's where one of the casinos is ***next*** uh but ***next*** 
a casino theatre okay ***next*** i haven't seen any shows in a casino theatre ***next*** but casinos are nice ***next*** yes ***next*** 
well i'd like ***next*** i'd like to take some photos of myself all over the place ***next*** so where are good spots where i can take photos ***next*** by the river just outside your hotel ***next*** 
by the river just outside your hotel ***next*** just outside the hotel ***next*** yes and walk down the river towards the bay ***next*** where the merlion is ***next*** 
no records of lions ***next*** so we think he saw perhaps a tiger or a big deer ***next*** and because we are a uh you know we are an island ***next*** and we were a fishing village ***next*** 
uh huh ***next*** but yah thank you ***next*** thanks for the help ***next*** your welcome ***next*** 
okay ***next*** thank you ***next*** ac~ ***next*** you said if you go to the you know ***next***

uh it's very original ***next*** yes it sounds unique ***next*** hm yes ***next*** how can i help you euke ***next*** 
from the time we arrived at the airport ***next*** uh you ***next*** there are ***next*** you can but you know you have a limited budget ***next*** 
how ***next*** yes ***next*** so normally we do a city tour where we bring you to the ethnic areas ***next*** uh like chinatown little india ***next*** 
and you can in fact take a riverboat ride in the bay ***next*** it's very scenic and it's very good for photography ***next*** so on the tour we would tell you things about singapore like the population ***next*** uh that we have a mixed culture of chinese malays and indians we have ***next*** 
but eh ***next*** could you speak a bit louder please ***next*** uh alright ***next*** alright uh ***next*** 
alright ***next*** now where in your place ***next*** where's the best place to have dinner around singapore ***next*** yes ***next*** 
uh actually if you are going to walk from the zoo to the night safari ***next*** you will have a limited choice of places to eat you ***next*** you will have a limited choice of places to eat you ***next*** i suggest you eat inside the night safari ***next*** 
i suggest you eat inside the night safari ***next*** oh there are restaurants inside the night safari ***next*** restaurants ***next*** yes then ***next*** 
would you ***next*** you want to go to the beach ***next*** would you mind to look for nice beaches in your country ***next*** i think one of the nicest beaches is on sentosa ***next*** 
uh but we do have uh very good views here i'll show you of the beach ***next*** there you go ***next*** if you get into the island uh there's no charge for swimming except if you use the lockers ***next*** that's all ***next*** 
we don't have a cottage ***next*** we usually just set up a place underneath the coconut tree or uh some people even just ***next*** oh ***next*** uh hang out at where the food places are ***next*** 
uh maybe if the sun is out it's a bit warm ***next*** so we try and hide under the shelter of some trees ***next*** alright because i thought it's um sentosa is a resort ***next*** yah there are resort hotels there ***next*** 
regard ***next*** about your country ***next*** oh there ***next*** okay are you getting the resort now ***next*** 
on the fifth ***next*** is that ***next*** sorry i thought it's the fourth ***next*** it's the fifth is it ***next*** 
uh because they are more the filipino people so it's quite affordable prices ***next*** so there is no restaurants which is owned by a filipino and caters filipino cuisine ***next*** these places they are i think owned by filipinos and uh ***next*** it's just that they're not highend you get what i mean ***next*** 
so will be ***next*** aside from these special exhibitions what other artefacts would we see or would be seen in the museum ***next*** it's ***next*** uh there is one with art and craft from sarawak jewellery uh and uh bas~ woven clothings that the villagers used to make ***next*** 
the merlion is the emblem of singapore uh tourism ***next*** oh it's the landmark ***next*** you mean the landmark ***next*** uh that's the ***next*** 
it is ***next*** there is a water flowing on its mouth ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** uh that's also a nice place to walk it's just that it's not very quiet ***next*** 
okay if you look at the map here ***next*** can you see the map ***next*** uh where you see this dot is the hotel ***next*** and your museum is just a little bit further down ***next*** 
i think i can go far with the one thousand singaporean dollar i have in my pocket ***next*** yes you will go very far ***next*** because you're staying only two nights ***next*** uh but uh ***next*** 
but um i prefer to go for the three attractions in the zoo ***next*** and then for the museum i think it won't cost much ***next*** no it's uh very cheap ***next*** you go on the next day in the morning free and easy after you wake up ***next*** 
oh yah ***next*** so it's still very cheap ***next*** alright ***next*** if you're a senior citizen you get a lot of discounts but you're not ***next*** 
so how much uh they uh ***next*** what is the price for this hotel is it ***next*** yah how much are the uh ***next*** okay we are looking approximately about just slightly over two hundred dollars ***next*** 
grand park hotel so i can also check on this one ***next*** what are the rates for the grand park hotel ***next*** i've s~ ***next*** sorry the price range is around two hundred ***next*** 
and yes they do serve some of our cuisine ***next*** otherwise i would also recommend to you uh just about ten minutes' walk ***next*** from the rendezvous hotel ***next*** um you'll be able to get to one fullerton ***next*** 
alright ***next*** it's inshort it will be a chinese style of cooking uh but using uh more malay uh spices ***next*** so do you like spicy food or most singaporean foods are spicy ***next*** uh i wouldn't say most singapore uh food are spicy it's ***next*** 
from the ***next*** from the hotel ***next*** yah from rendezvous hotel ***next*** okay ***next***

uh you will pass by some of the highlight the financial district area ***next*** uh so you see a lot of skyscrapers ***next*** and uh you will see uh bridges ***next*** alright old bridges in singapore ***next*** 
okay this is the programme that i would say uh it has something for your son to do ***next*** yah ***next*** as well as uh a little bit of relaxing cruise in the night time ***next*** but of course there are lots of other things that you can do in singapore ***next*** 
yah ***next*** as well as uh a little bit of relaxing cruise in the night time ***next*** but of course there are lots of other things that you can do in singapore ***next*** for example we have universal studio in sentosa ***next***

oh for swimming okay ***next*** i like swimming yup ***next*** uh well the changi beach and the east coast beach um will not be fine sand ***next*** alright it's a little bit rocky ***next*** 
alright it's a little bit rocky ***next*** okay ***next*** the sand is a little bit um coarse ***next*** but uh on saturdays afternoon and sundays afternoon the ***next*** 
from seven thirty to eight o'clock ***next*** again it is an open night safari you won't see cages in this night safari ***next*** it is just next door to the zoo ***next*** okay so if your son is really into animals you could do the afternoon zoo ***next*** 
so ***next*** and if you are not too tired again there is a forest giant trail ***next*** again from the entrance area that you can walk ***next*** alright fishing cat trail about twenty minutes ***next*** 
hm and how about the admission fee how much is that ***next*** how much is that ***next*** okay the admission fee for the night safari will be thirty two dollars for the adult ***next*** and the child will be twenty one dollars ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh huh ***next*** but do check on your passport you know what is the validity that's given to you ***next*** but i would say normally one month ***next*** 
for the child it will be fifty dollars ***next*** and weekend will be uh fifty four uh dollars ***next*** uh also for uh certain rides in the universal studio there's a height limit ***next*** uh for certain rides like roller coaster the child would be have ***next*** 
yes i will ***next*** thank you so much ***next*** alright ***next*** welcome ***next*** 
hi ***next*** hi cris ***next*** good morning ***next*** my name is jeanne ***next*** 
uh the hotels ***next*** yah ***next*** the hotels in chinatown tend to be rather uh small ***next*** because they are converted from ***next*** 
i ***next*** yes ***next*** well it's kinda unique ***next*** yes ***next*** 
keong saik road in my father's and grandfather's time ***next*** was a redlight district ***next*** but it is all cleaned up now ***next*** and that's why we have hotels there ***next*** 
per cent are airconditioned ***next*** almost all are airconditioned now ***next*** uh unless the air conditioner uh breaks down ***next*** uh and some of them are doubledecker buses ***next*** 
can you see the map now ***next*** yes ***next*** i can see it now ***next*** okay ***next*** 
you will have to buy adult tickets ***next*** because the thirteenyearold is not a student in singapore ***next*** he's not a young child ***next*** he is not ***next*** 
he is not ***next*** you know if he's six or seven you can get a child ticket ***next*** but he has to get adult ticket ***next*** so you take your green line and you follow it down to city hall ***next*** 
uh it's right in the heart of chinatown ***next*** and the restaurant is called lee kui uh (ah hoi) ***next*** lee kui ***next*** uh it's in a street called mosque street ***next*** 
i love vinegar so i like this dish ***next*** well the counterpart of that is this spicy crab ***next*** so is it cooked or is it raw ***next*** well no ***next*** 
well is it affordable for ***next*** you know for uh three people ***next*** three people um maybe seventy dollars i would think ***next*** it depends on how big is your appetite how much you order ***next*** 
okay ***next*** i just must taken out of that in terms of budgeting ***next*** uh they have also something like ***next*** deep fried pork and liver roll ***next*** 
you know kinda like tshirts ***next*** yes ***next*** all over ***next*** when you walk out of your hotel and you walk down the main road ***next*** 
in that time ***next*** well ***next*** all along the same street there are other restaurants ***next*** so you can just you know walk through and have a look ***next*** 
uh one or two stops it doesn't make a difference ***next*** either telok blangah or labrador you get off uh the bus ***next*** uh get off the train and you get on to a bus ***next*** uh when you reached the bus stop at the back ***next*** 
and bring your camera you can take lots of photos ***next*** i see ***next*** so we're allowed to bring food inside the park ***next*** yes you are ***next*** 
uh which is uh just nearby ***next*** and you will also pass a food centre ***next*** so you might want to check out some of the local foods there ***next*** we have a lot of uh muslim food ***next*** 
so you might want to check out some of the local foods there ***next*** we have a lot of uh muslim food ***next*** and we also have my favourite fish soup stall there ***next*** in the middle of the food centre ***next*** 
and one dollar for your bus ride ***next*** and when you come out ***next*** uh you are not given tickets when you come out ***next*** it's free of charge to take the buses out ***next*** 
i believe it's on the budget ***next*** yes ***next*** it's all still on the budget ***next*** and if you want to eat in chinatown at the food centre's uh street side ***next*** 
it's all still on the budget ***next*** and if you want to eat in chinatown at the food centre's uh street side ***next*** it's very cheap ***next*** it's under ten dollars for each of you ***next*** 
oh sorry the singapore ***next*** a big museum for singaporeans to enjoy ***next*** both of them would be combined ***next*** um you can walk from there towards the seaward side ***next*** 
because uh where the merlion is ***next*** uh nearby is the start of the mouth of the singapore river ***next*** and that's where sir stamford raffles landed which he's a british ***next*** who came here to look for a trading port ***next*** 
to little india uh usually two stops about 5 minutes ***next*** but on this line ***next*** so maybe seven or eight minutes ***next*** but uh you have to factor in walking down to the station in getting out ***next*** 
the uh vegetable sellers and visit the hindu temples before twelve o'clock ***next*** because they ***next*** yah they close around twelve to about four o'clock ***next*** and then they reopen ***next*** 
e~ ***next*** there is also dessert stall in chinatown ***next*** uh that specialises in uh pureed sesame paste and pureed peanut paste ***next*** uh just about one street away from where you are ***next*** 
to collect rainwater that falls in the city area and also to prevent flooding ***next*** uh if you want to walk i think on men~ ***next*** sentosa uh after you visit universal studios ***next*** take a walk along the beach ***next*** 
if you want uh garden ***next*** do you like gardens uh besides hortpark ***next*** also ***next*** we have another garden that is very famous and older one ***next*** 
also more of uh open space ***next*** whereas if you reached hortpark and it's raining ***next*** they have a big covered area near the entrance ***next*** where you can wait out the rain and you can walk to this place ***next*** 
oh it's great ***next*** so beautiful ***next*** it's a ***next*** yah ***next*** 
again as i said the prices there are quite competitive ***next*** because there are so many of them ***next*** so you can just walk along and uh you can in fact ask the prices before you go in ***next*** uh in fact some of them they just put up a sign to say uh so many dollars for a jug of beer ***next*** 
that it looks expensive ***next*** because expatriate community are also seen there ***next*** yes hm ***next*** but it's not actually ***next*** 
because expatriate community are also seen there ***next*** yes hm ***next*** but it's not actually ***next*** uh there is one bar i like there ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and clarke quay is ***next*** and boat quay ***next*** we also have robertson quay ***next*** 
yes ***next*** one of the famous just ***next*** you know just want to look at also ***next*** there are very many famous malls in singapore ***next*** 
you just walk there ***next*** so you buy your souvenirs and you end up at a uh temple and the museum ***next*** uh now you want to have ***next*** do you want to see the other temple ***next*** 
uh now you want to have ***next*** do you want to see the other temple ***next*** i show it to you ***next*** the thian hock keng temple ***next*** 
so ***next*** uh huh ***next*** this is ***next*** you see this temple is a bit new ***next*** 
Empty ***next*** Empty ***next*** hi good morning ***next*** this is uh tour guide one ***next*** 
uh you can either take uh the whole day it's fine ***next*** um unless it is raining then otherwise uh morning you get a different kind of view ***next*** evening if you're taking at night that's also nice ***next*** because then you see the lights coming on ***next*** 
um in the southern part of singapore ***next*** so either morning it's a bright morning ***next*** uh afternoon it's same ***next*** at night if you want to see the lights then yes ***next*** 
roller coaster if you ***next*** madagascar and our latest ride would be the transformer ***next*** the first picture over here ***next*** okay so this is something i think the whole family will enjoy ***next*** 
uh it will be for uh one person ***next*** the rates ***next*** that's great ***next*** yah ***next*** 
there is a street food call the chinatown complex ***next*** and over there um they serve uh local food ***next*** and one meal let's say if you are just having the uh rice with three dishes ***next*** that will cost you approximately about five singapore dollars ***next*** 
um if ever that um we are in the inn hotel eh at uh temple street ***next*** um how long it will for us to go to sentosa singapore flyer ***next*** and what will be the ride that we can use to go there ***next*** tem~ ***next*** 
uh the closest one of course would be the chinatown mrt ***next*** the other ho~ ***next*** uh mrt would be tanjong pagar ***next*** now tanjong pagar is actually the eastwest line that you will take ***next*** 
to go to the um harbourfront alright ***next*** uh but if you are sorry ***next*** uh no you take the chinatown uh station and go to the harbourfront ***next*** um but let say you are going to take uh to the singapore flyer ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh i would think uh do you have budget airlines coming in ***next*** actually our budget um is one thousand singaporean dollars ***next*** okay ***next*** 
so um what about um the weather or do you have any advance weather forecast ***next*** um for the specific date that we'll uh like to go ***next*** uh we have the same kind of temperature throughout the whole year ***next*** uh so there's no uh really specific time ***next*** 
yes sometime in november ***next*** and christmas time is also a very festive because ***next*** uh we light up the whole street of orchard road ***next*** so it gives you that very festive mood ***next*** 
um how long um it will take for us to go there from the hotel that you gave it to u~ ***next*** uh to the hotel that you gave it to me ***next*** yes ***next*** okay you will have to uh ***next*** 
and they will be eating the wrong kind food if we give them the human food ***next*** so they have special uh food that the zoo keepers will feed them ***next*** so strictly no feeding ***next*** um and also uh we ***next*** 
so they have special uh food that the zoo keepers will feed them ***next*** so strictly no feeding ***next*** um and also uh we ***next*** for the night safari because these animals most of the animals are nocturnal creatures ***next*** 
when we take pictures ***next*** uh we do not uh want to damage the eyes of these uh nocturnal creatures ***next*** because being nocturnal creatures they have very sharp uh eyesight ***next*** so we don't want to damage uh their eyes ***next*** 
any parts of your body to yourself ***next*** do not stretch them out ***next*** do not touch the animals because they are wild animals ***next*** so this is something interesting as well as and of course on the tram ride ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yes ***next*** but uh in order to see this leopard ***next*** you will have to walk uh remember just now the tram ride ***next*** 
and again the last trail it will be the forest giant trail right ***next*** so these are the three uh trails uh that you can do um for the uh tour over in the night safari ***next*** okay so it's up to you whether you are too tired you don't feel like walking ***next*** on the tram ride you see seventy per cent of the animals ***next*** 
night shows ***next*** yes ***next*** we have a night shows at the um uh night safari park ***next*** we call it the creatures of the night show ***next*** 
i mean span time from six pm is that right ***next*** the night safari starts at seven thirty a~ ***next*** seven thirty ***next*** yes and it uh ***next*** 
seven thirty ***next*** yes and it uh ***next*** until twelve midnight ***next*** twelve midnight yes ***next*** 
and from there take uh um a train back to your hotel ***next*** now in singapore it's pretty safe to travel around in the night ***next*** but as usual anywhere else in the world you just avoid all the dark lanes ***next*** um and do not uh carry too much cash with you that's all ***next*** 
the mrt train station will be somerset station ***next*** okay now let me just try and show you the photograph of this borderx ***next*** this one lynnette is um we're going to climb a building right ***next*** yes uh a wall i would say ***next*** 
uh yes and all the climbing gear the safety gear will all be provided ***next*** wow that's great ***next*** and that is open from ***next*** yah ***next*** 
um are we allowed to um ***next*** i mean what part of the singapore can we buy some souvenirs ***next*** that we can bring home ***next*** okay ***next*** 
another yes you can see right ***next*** so it's tasty ***next*** yah its look delicious ***next*** yah ***next*** 
and another dish that i would like to recommend you will be fried carrot cake ***next*** this is a savoury food ***next*** okay it's savoury ***next*** it's actually white radish ***next*** 
this is a savoury food ***next*** okay it's savoury ***next*** it's actually white radish ***next*** you can see it's actually white radish um cooked with rice flour ***next*** 
oh i see ***next*** black sauce ***next*** yah so it has a tinge of sweetness in there ***next*** the white colour will be savoury ***next*** 
so everywhere you travel give yourself one hour is more than sufficient ***next*** generally it should be a travelling time about half an hour ***next*** okay there are so many clubs uh that are very good ***next*** uh again it depends on price range ***next*** 
there are quite a few clubs there as well ***next*** wow ***next*** okay ***next*** so you want something more affordable right ***next*** 
over at saint james it range from about forty dollars up to a hundred ***next*** uh then of course there more expensive club uh world famous like uh ku dÉ ta ***next*** uh that's over at marina ***next*** you're familiar with this club ***next*** 
hm where to go in singapore ***next*** but can you give me at least five to ten hottest places there ***next*** okay ***next*** hot as in hotspots like uh the dance clubs ***next*** 
quite a lot of the local like to climb this hill as well ***next*** um and it's basically a very easy walk ***next*** but of course if you want a more challenging walk up the hill ***next*** then you can do the trail ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so this is the bukit timah hill ***next*** um but mountain climbing like i said we don't have mountains here ***next*** this is only a hill ***next*** 
wow ***next*** right ***next*** next one extreme uh swing ***next*** and this is something quite new is ifly ***next*** 
the next one ***next*** and i think you may find uh ***next*** okay and we have also the extreme skate park ***next*** over here in the east coast ***next*** 
over here in the east coast ***next*** and so that gives you a lot of uh excitement interesting things to do ***next*** this is a free admission huh ***next*** but of course you are to bring your own skate ***next*** 
so borderx it's conveniently located ***next*** it's in orchard road ***next*** ski and um the ski cable ski is on the east coast ***next*** so you could do that together with uh sport of swimming in the east coast area or changi area ***next*** 
now um ifly would be on sentosa island ***next*** so in case you're going to sentosa island for a swim or to do the theme park ***next*** you could do that huh ***next*** uh wakeboarding it's somewhere near the southern part of singapore ***next*** 
i know pretty sure that there's a lot of activities in chinatown right ***next*** yes ***next*** uh more activities you see a lot more in chinatown ***next*** uh sometime during the january period ***next*** 
uh otherwise yes it's a nice uh um a walk ***next*** along some of the different uh uh different uh lanes of chinatown ***next*** uh it's ***next*** so of course you see the traditional houses ***next*** 
along some of the different uh uh different uh lanes of chinatown ***next*** uh it's ***next*** so of course you see the traditional houses ***next*** that's flashed on your screen now ***next*** 
and of course something that you can bring home ***next*** would be the barbecue uh meat slices ***next*** and some of them comes in vacuum pack ***next*** and it's very easy for you to bring home ***next*** 
and so how much can i pay for that ***next*** uh for the barbecue pork slices ***next*** yap ***next*** okay normal prices uh excluding the chinese new year period ***next*** 
uh chinatown heritage centre ***next*** okay so uh this is the chinatown uh heritage centre yah ***next*** just a few uh gallery photos for you to see ***next*** it's located right in the heart of chinatown ***next*** 
and it also nears in airport right ***next*** okay ***next*** orch~ ***next*** yah orchard yes ***next*** 
so very typical uh chinese pastry ***next*** uh and something that's very interesting would be a round kind of cake ***next*** called the mooncake ***next*** uh normally yah ***next*** 
oh not bad ***next*** yah so this is the uh mooncake festival ***next*** and of course in this ***next*** during this festival a lot of the people ***next*** 
okay i'm gonna show the images of the mooncake festival ***next*** okay you can see this is mooncake ***next*** alright ***next*** yah uh traditionally of course it should be brown ***next*** 
the festival itself is just one day yah ***next*** so i think ***next*** oh one day festival okay ***next*** yes it's just for the one day festival ***next*** 
no it's uh just a few street ***next*** uh and you can walk ***next*** uh you can easily finish kampong glam in two hours ***next*** and since you're there don't forget to try some malay food ***next***

i mean from most of our food centre ***next*** aircondition non aircondition ***next*** or even restaurants chinese restaurant they offer this ***next*** um uh to uh the guest ***next***

uh then we have also shopping malls ***next*** uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront ***next*** vivocity is newer ***next*** and it has got uh a very huge singaporean following on uh weekends ***next*** 
uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront ***next*** vivocity is newer ***next*** and it has got uh a very huge singaporean following on uh weekends ***next*** i'm showing you orchard road on the screen first ***next*** 
so you can see we've got gucci there ***next*** it's ***next*** you can get all the good brands there ***next*** but there are also shops that sell things like g two thousand ***next*** 
uh let me go to the shopping alright ***next*** we have a list of shops here ***next*** oh you have to search for the store ***next*** let me see ***next*** 
so what's your favourite shop jeanne ***next*** um i'd like to go to an old store that has kept up with the times and modernised ***next*** and it's called c k tang ***next*** tangs is the short form t a n g ***next*** 
um what about jewellery ***next*** jewellery ***next*** okay these are the stores we have ***next*** bulgari uh cartier ***next*** 
so can you see citigems on your screen ***next*** uh hm i can ***next*** so this is a huge shopping area called the shoppes at marina bay sands ***next*** can you see on the right hand side of your screen ***next*** 
i'm really just at the planning stage right now ***next*** okay but uh ***next*** i will ***next*** we have got marina bay sands still on the screen ***next*** 
um one room ***next*** one room is enough huh ***next*** yup ***next*** uh one room ***next*** 
but this hotel is safe right ***next*** i mean ***next*** oh it's very safe ***next*** it's in the heart of chinatown ***next*** 
uh i did ***next*** we did step into the bathroom and check out ***next*** because you know around there are skyscrapers all the hotel uh buildings and uh office buildings ***next*** but they have a lot of greenery around ***next*** 
it is uh quite okay ***next*** you should actually check it out and have a look ***next*** it's just that you know uh this is quite nice ***next*** because it's right at the top of the hotel ***next*** 
do you have pictures of that ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** here we go ***next*** 
it's really nice jeanne ***next*** it's just that i think with the price of the junior suite ***next*** i might not have enough money to go to the places that i want to go to ***next*** uh you should have enough ***next*** 
i might not have enough money to go to the places that i want to go to ***next*** uh you should have enough ***next*** uh what was the price of uh your show ***next*** it's a hundred and eight dollars right ***next*** 
so that's gonna be around four hundred already plus you know the addons ***next*** seven hundred over dollars yah ***next*** so ***next*** you have to go down on your uh expectations for the show ***next*** 
so maybe uh ***next*** i'll maybe go for the deluxe room then ***next*** and we'll definitely go to the um zoo for my kid ***next*** the zoo price was about sixty dollars right ***next*** 
i'll maybe go for the deluxe room then ***next*** and we'll definitely go to the um zoo for my kid ***next*** the zoo price was about sixty dollars right ***next*** uh somewhere around that ***next*** 
just a minute ***next*** right ***next*** okay ***next*** do you want to see the sup~ ***next*** 
um well do you have other pictures ***next*** because from the picture that i looked at earlier um ***next*** okay ***next*** no ***next*** 
let me see i forget the price ***next*** package price for the three in one ***next*** for the night safari zoo and the bird park right ***next*** the wildlife reserves ***next*** 
of course ***next*** uh can you downgrade to the fifty eight dollar ticket for the show ***next*** wouldn't that be too far or do you think that's just right ***next*** no it's not too far ***next*** 
hm it will not uh break the bank ***next*** uh maybe you shall pay uh twenty dollars or twenty five dollars for the ticket ***next*** uh it's called the ezlink card for ***next*** you know when you travel by train and by bus ***next*** 
uh maybe you shall pay uh twenty dollars or twenty five dollars for the ticket ***next*** uh it's called the ezlink card for ***next*** you know when you travel by train and by bus ***next*** you use this card to pay for your fare so you don't have to use any money ***next*** 
so um ***next*** so i need to get two of those correct ***next*** you need to get three uh ***next*** you need to get three uh to to use for your daughter as well ***next*** 
oh i love it ***next*** and this place is a very old market that also has been restored ***next*** and the good thing is you can see food that is being sold ***next*** you can see ***next*** 
not bad ***next*** so the food there is good huh ***next*** yes very good ***next*** uh i eat there quite often ***next*** 
it is ***next*** she's very generous with the ingredients chicken and the rice ***next*** uh and if you ***next*** do you know porridge rice porridge ***next*** 
do you know porridge rice porridge ***next*** yup ***next*** uh so that too ***next*** so don't order like five dollars just order the minimum ***next*** 
uh there is what we called uh teochew porridge ***next*** so it is rice porridge and there are sort of variety of dishes ***next*** like steam fish fried fish uh salted egg vegetables ***next*** different vegetables cooked in different ways tofu ***next*** 
different vegetables cooked in different ways tofu ***next*** so you pick what you want and you eat it ***next*** uh so it depends on what you pick fish ***next*** uh a whole fish of course is more expensive ***next*** 
usually ***next*** i think yes there is a thai ***next*** there is what she call herself japanese ***next*** but you know it's the cheaper type of japanese food there ***next*** 
so it's at the lower end ***next*** maybe you pay five dollars for rice and um uh piece of meat ***next*** a sizeable piece of meat on your rice ***next*** and for thai food you will get your usual green mango you know ***next*** 
maybe you pay five dollars for rice and um uh piece of meat ***next*** a sizeable piece of meat on your rice ***next*** and for thai food you will get your usual green mango you know ***next*** uh the sour and sweet mango ***next*** 
so if you want to try different cuisines just outside your hotel you can find ***next*** wow ***next*** you have like ***next*** we also have a food street there it's called smith street ***next*** 
it's the food street of singapore ***next*** smith street okay ***next*** and what about the prices of the food there ***next*** about more or less the same ***next*** 
very colour~ ***next*** ye~ ***next*** yes ***next*** uh they ***next*** 
so in in china they are used to keep chinese medicines ***next*** even liquidised medicines inside these containers ***next*** so when you give this away to somebody ***next*** it is uh a symbol of wishing him good health and longevity ***next*** 
it is uh a symbol of wishing him good health and longevity ***next*** so new year you can get them ***next*** uh usually you'll give them to the older people ***next*** it's symbolic nobody would put medicine in them now ***next*** 
these are the fans ***next*** uh you might want to get one just to fan yourself when you're walking around ***next*** and that if you take care of it it will last ***next*** can you see it's a dollar ***next*** 
and hand painted no not really ***next*** uh i think it's printed ***next*** you can get th~ ***next*** uh there is a calligrapher there in chinatown who will draw your ***next*** 
uh this is a skill from the chinese uh are very good at ***next*** they fold paper up and then they cut it ***next*** and after they finish cutting they open up the paper ***next*** and you've got this wonderful design uh ***next*** 
wow colourful ***next*** uh if i'm not mistaken i once saw a chopsticks for children ***next*** where they attached the two chopsticks together ***next*** so she cannot lose the chopstick while she's eating ***next*** 
uh it's a special fish song he that the chinese like ***next*** they believe that it can cure them of um sickness and things like that ***next*** and here it's cooked ***next*** you can see the dish it's around fifteen dollars ***next*** 
oh so it's a little bony ***next*** yah the way ***next*** because it's near the heat to you'll scales ***next*** you know that what's inside the mouth here and there ***next*** 
um how much is that ***next*** uh let me see ***next*** how much is that gonna cost ***next*** yah ***next*** 
no problem ***next*** okay ***next*** i think it's the waterfront grandstand if i'm not mistaken ***next*** i cannot remember exactly ***next*** 
okay ***next*** sounds good ***next*** and you ***next*** so you can actually come in one day earlier ***next*** 
we close our streets and we have lots of concerts ***next*** okay ***next*** so the race starts at the pit here ***next*** can you see ***next*** 
that's the one that is two hundred over dollars i believe ***next*** okay ***next*** and that ***next*** one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars ***next*** 
uh there are some a little bit better value ***next*** in the sense that uh for those who want privacy ***next*** let's see if we can find one for you here ***next*** okay ***next*** 
so air conditioning is like a must in hotels ***next*** okay ***next*** that sounds good ***next*** and if you are serious about coming ***next*** 
uh it depends on the hotel ***next*** uh nowadays the hotels know that this is a peak period ***next*** so i don't think you'll get a discount ***next*** um in the regular hotels in fact you'll have to pay more ***next*** 
sure ***next*** okay ***next*** let me see whether we can get a picture of this ***next*** whether they have rooms for you ***next*** 
you are very near to town ***next*** and you can get to your race very easily by the trains ***next*** okay ***next*** the ones that say "geylang" are too far away ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so this is a onestar hotel ***next*** uh one or two stars ***next*** yah we don't go by the star system in singapore ***next*** 
it's ***next*** if you would travel far then you waste time traveling ***next*** okay ***next*** and there are also maybe traffic jams and uh ***next*** 
and there are also maybe traffic jams and uh ***next*** because there is road closure ***next*** uh for where the races run ***next*** so traffic is diverted ***next*** 
but there's a centre i will recommend you to ***next*** it's uh an it centre ***next*** so they have laptops they have the peripherals ***next*** and what i normally advice people to do ***next*** 
and what i normally advice people to do ***next*** is to go around the stores ***next*** be honest and tell them you are checking prices ***next*** and you'll come back if they are giving you a good deal ***next*** 
i think little india looks like a flea market ***next*** with all the stalls filling out into the street ***next*** but you can go to a place called bugis ***next*** where we have a little lane and there are lots of little stalls ***next*** 
uh depends on the size of the item ***next*** they have them really small for people who want tiny things ***next*** and they have them bigger ***next*** and it depends on you know what it is made of ***next*** 
uh no ***next*** this is ***next*** well there is food all around ***next*** but here it seems to be having a food fair ***next*** 
okay ***next*** but just opposite is the lane ***next*** where you uh have shops on your left and right ***next*** and you have a whole range of items from ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so it's more of the broth of the chicken ***next*** uh that's the same thing that you use for cooking the rice is that it ***next*** uh yes ***next*** 
is it ***next*** would it be a cup of rice or is it just how ***next*** like how many servings ***next*** uh sometimes they have a fix deal ***next*** 
mantau ***next*** is it mantau or mantou ***next*** yes ***next*** that's right ***next*** 
uh yah ***next*** clams steamed and they have mixed garlic ***next*** and it's a light dish ***next*** so this uh clams they actually looked like bamboo ***next*** 
hm okay ***next*** that's good ***next*** the vendors in little india are very accommodating ***next*** they're very friendly ***next*** 
hm okay ***next*** so four hundred dollars ***next*** that's good enough for food and then for shopping ***next*** yes for food ***next*** 
ten dollars ***next*** if you will order ***next*** yah ***next*** if you walk in uh there's a little indian restaurant opposite a hindu temple ***next*** 
they're just between one dollar and maybe two fifty ***next*** that's all ***next*** okay ***next*** so it's not expensive ***next*** 
so it's not expensive ***next*** and uh does singapore also provide or serve ethnic food ***next*** ethnic food would be the food you get in little india ***next*** in chinatown would be the chinese food ***next*** 
yes ***next*** it's very nice ***next*** uh you've got to come before the new year ***next*** because during the chinese new year ***next*** 
and um what else would you suggest that i do ***next*** um aside from the f one race ***next*** and then trying out the singaporean delicacies ***next*** okay ***next*** 
is it along side boat quay ***next*** and there are ***next*** okay ***next*** yes so do you see boat quay ***next*** 
uh not inside the exhibits there ***next*** because uh i think one is for security reasons ***next*** and sometimes people forget to switch off their flash ***next*** and you would fade the exhibits ***next*** 
so i can definitely take pictures as long as i turn off the flash ***next*** yes but you check with the security before you enter ***next*** uh just to be sure yah ***next*** um we have an southeast asian exhibit ***next*** 
uh so let me see huh ***next*** so the acm is here ***next*** your um seats for watching the f one ***next*** is where the cricket club is just around the corner ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so walking distance and your uh rice chicken ***next*** uh sorry your chili crab is down boat quay ***next*** just a little bit further down ***next*** 
and you may even get it free ***next*** that's talk about allowing you free entry to the museums ***next*** and uh do they also sell souvenirs in the museum ***next*** yes ***next*** 
your mrt ***next*** how does one train ride cost ***next*** it goes by distance ***next*** so it depends on how far you travel ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and when you go down westwards you travel down ***next*** if you are going to book into the hotel in little india ***next*** you switch ***next*** 
yes ***next*** and the rest of your rides would be from little india uh down to ***next*** if you want to go to chinatown it's two stops ***next*** you can also stop at clarke quay which is uh ***next*** 
is that the river ***next*** okay ***next*** yes ***next*** and you could walk from clarke quay uh to the f one sites ***next*** 
beautiful view for the background ***next*** if you uh don't want to get off at clarke quay ***next*** you can also go to city hall from dhoby ghaut ***next*** can you see ***next*** 
you can also go to city hall from dhoby ghaut ***next*** can you see ***next*** you switch to city hall station ***next*** and that's also in the area ***next*** 
part of it is above ground ***next*** when you come down from the airport ***next*** you get a good view until kallang yes ***next*** and then it goes underground because that area is builtup ***next*** 
uh chinatown uh the night clubbing areas back into the major cities ***next*** this is more to service singaporeans who have a night out ***next*** and you know they don't drive ***next*** they can get home near enough to their homes ***next*** 
i appreciate it ***next*** alright ***next*** you don't want to wait for the picture of geylang ***next*** no ***next*** 
Empty ***next*** hello ***next*** hello ***next*** hello good morning or good afternoon ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so you want backpacker but you want to have a room ***next*** or rather the lowest priced rooms that you can get ***next*** 
uh okay ***next*** because you really ***next*** you don't want dormitory ***next*** you also want to have uh a room right ***next*** 
yah ***next*** something that's uh you know affordable by middle class families ***next*** okay ***next*** let me see ***next*** 
we have to look at your budget ***next*** alright ***next*** le~ ***next*** let's look at under a hundred ***next*** 
well so it sounds like that uh hotel near the chinese restaurant is the winner ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** keong saik street ***next*** uh ninety dollars is actually a very good deal ***next*** 
keong saik street ***next*** uh ninety dollars is actually a very good deal ***next*** because it's right in town ***next*** uh and it is near the civic district which is our historic area and near the river ***next*** 
that sounds pretty great ***next*** uh do you know what kind of uh amenities that the hotel offers ***next*** okay ***next*** let's have a look here ***next*** 
i mean yah you speak english pretty well ***next*** uh yes uh but if i went to chinatown ***next*** i sort of naturally speak singlish a little bit ***next*** uh because i adopt what people are telling me ***next*** 
but it's still such a short trip ***next*** so huh ***next*** yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars ***next*** yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars ***next*** 
so here we have the uh ***next*** there is a tram ride and there's also uh walking trail ***next*** so if you walk fast and you are not too tired out ***next*** you can take the tram ride ***next*** 
do we get interaction with any of the uh safari animals ***next*** safari animals ***next*** like i said after the show they bring them out and you can handle them ***next*** have your boyfriend take photos with you ***next*** 
safari animals ***next*** like i said after the show they bring them out and you can handle them ***next*** have your boyfriend take photos with you ***next*** uh the interaction in the daytime ***next*** 
like i said after the show they bring them out and you can handle them ***next*** have your boyfriend take photos with you ***next*** uh the interaction in the daytime ***next*** in the day zoo so it's when you go for first with the orangutans ***next*** 
that's right ***next*** so do you want to know the ticket prices ***next*** oh yes please ***next*** uh wait ***next*** 
this is the leopard cat ***next*** you are only allowed in after dark ***next*** those are anteaters ***next*** they are really beautiful ***next*** 
they are really beautiful ***next*** can you see seventhirty to twelve ***next*** why is it the night safari and not the daytime safari ***next*** so you ***next*** 
oh i see ***next*** so the first visit whether it's a bird park zoo or night safari ***next*** you can buy this ticket ***next*** uh except if you are buying you know bird park and night safari ***next*** 
so the first visit whether it's a bird park zoo or night safari ***next*** you can buy this ticket ***next*** uh except if you are buying you know bird park and night safari ***next*** of course you won't be at the zoo twice ***next*** 
so ***next*** uh no ***next*** the underpasses yes it's quite recent ***next*** and uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it ***next*** 
the underpasses yes it's quite recent ***next*** and uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it ***next*** so that they can you know don't have to negotiate traffic light junctions ***next*** and it's a seamless travel from place to place ***next*** 
and uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it ***next*** so that they can you know don't have to negotiate traffic light junctions ***next*** and it's a seamless travel from place to place ***next*** so here you're seeing some of the scenes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** less upscale ***next*** okay ***next*** uh you are in chinatown ***next*** 
does uh singapore offer like a variety of uh tea and herbs ***next*** wel ***next*** yes ***next*** uh we have the chinese medicinal shops that sell chinese herbs ***next*** 
it's within walking distance ***next*** maybe ten minutes if you walk slowly ***next*** this part of chinatown is a little bit busier and has more traffic ***next*** your side of where your hotel is it's quieter ***next*** 
and oh uh also a spa ***next*** okay spas ***next*** there are in chinatown ***next*** uh you will be able to see them as you walked around ***next*** 
i think the beach is quite near or you can ***next*** if the beach is not near you can just take a shuttle to near the beach ***next*** they are internal shuttles within sentosa ***next*** uh let me have a look ***next*** 
uh you can take shuttle buses ***next*** so can you see getting there the different coloured lines ***next*** yah ***next*** blue red and green ***next*** 
yap ***next*** uh it's like wakeboarding or um water skiing ***next*** uh water skiing ***next*** it is along ***next*** 
yes that is separate ***next*** that would be on this island called sentosa ***next*** where you go to the beach ***next*** so you would cover this on the same day you go the beach ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so what happened is let me described it to you ***next*** you see uh marine fishes which are very colorful ***next*** the ones in the tropics ***next*** 
so instead of like me being the uh one watching the animals ***next*** they're watching us ***next*** yes that's right ***next*** so uh th ***next*** 
and there are signboards at the side to show you ***next*** you know usually what's animal ***next*** uh what species is there they will display it ***next*** and there's also attached to this aquarium uh dolphin show ***next*** 
uh you will just pay a little fee ***next*** and it will get a little bit wet ***next*** you don't have to go all the way in ***next*** but you can go down shake hands with the ***next*** 
uh no the sharks you don't get to swim to do anything with them ***next*** except see them behind glass ***next*** uh okay ***next*** uh so that's ***next*** 
yes definitely ***next*** okay ***next*** so you're comfortable taking the trains ***next*** you take the ezlink ticket from the basement of the airport ***next*** 
um i'm participant number thirty ***next*** my name is dodie victor ***next*** uh number thirteen ***next*** how do you spell your name ***next*** 
um i wonder if you can help me out ***next*** yes of course ***next*** you need to ***next*** first you sound like a young man are you ***next*** 
but whether on the island if you want to visit attractions then it's ***next*** uh whichever attraction you pick uh it has a fee ***next*** hm so what are the top uh attractions in sentosa ***next*** okay ***next*** 
so uh of the top of per head about two hundred over dollars ***next*** in chinatown you can get them for around a hundred or even less ***next*** and you can also stay in the heritage area known as little india ***next*** and if you come out of there ***next*** 
so um yah you mentioned that i have to stay in chinatown ***next*** get a hotel in there before i go to sentosa ***next*** so is that something that i have to do by foot or do i actually have to reserve a vehicle for transportation ***next*** uh you don't really have to stay in chinatown ***next*** 
will i u~ ***next*** actually use a bo ***next*** mobile phone to contact someone ***next*** the ***next*** 
and there will be many signs marked out ***next*** there'll also be people there willing to help you ***next*** you can ask anybody around you ***next*** they'll be able to point you the way ***next*** 
yes yes ***next*** i've seen it on tv ***next*** but uh they had a singapore sector ***next*** but i miss that ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay ***next*** uh anyway when you buy your ticket ***next*** you should be able to get a map from the airport ***next*** 
you should be able to get a map from the airport ***next*** uh and if you need help from the officer ***next*** he will tell you ***next*** anyway since you mentioned it ***next*** 
because it's near the singapore river where you can have althe ***next*** al fresco dining if you don't want to eat outside your hotel ***next*** and you can see we have a list of hotels here that are not very expensive ***next*** but uh decent hotels also ***next*** 
uh let me get the ones in chinatown ***next*** so can you see a list of the prices there ***next*** yah i can ***next*** uh if you want a quaint hotel uh with nice design ***next*** 
a haunted place yah ***next*** i just wanna to try it out ***next*** it's a strange thing ***next*** oh you are strange ***next*** 
oh you are strange ***next*** okay uh later ***next*** you can go and do shopping uh at the street ***next*** where people used to wait to die ***next*** 
here ***next*** yes ***next*** keong saik ***next*** keong saik yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** keong saik ***next*** keong saik yes ***next*** that's on the same street and uh i must tell you that ***next*** 
i've been in this area ***next*** i've been in nineteen twentynine which invited ***next*** travel agents and people in the ***next*** tour business to visit ***next*** 
i've been in nineteen twentynine which invited ***next*** travel agents and people in the ***next*** tour business to visit ***next*** but i haven't been in this other one ***next*** 
you can find places to have uh supper ***next*** the shops around there might close around ten o'clock ***next*** but if you want to have a drink ***next*** i would prefer you go down to the singapore river where the ambiance is uh by the singapore river ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and in this vicinity we also have other churches ***next*** let me try and get for you ***next*** there's the saint joseph's church ***next*** 
so this is saint joseph ***next*** yes ***next*** and uh there's another one called saints peter and paul ***next*** which is three minutes away from there ***next*** 
they are within walking distance ***next*** all three of them ***next*** oh this is also nice ***next*** yes very pretty ***next*** 
ten minutes walking ***next*** by walking ***next*** walki~ ***next*** yes ***next*** 
but um i've tried a few indian food as well but um ***next*** what's the other ***next*** chi~ ***next*** vietnamese ***next*** 
can you see bras basah here ***next*** on the little map ***next*** yes ***next*** so it's along the same road is just stretching down a little bit ***next*** 
yes ***next*** o~ ***next*** okay ***next*** uh quite near to here and you can walk if you like ***next*** 
or if you are too tired uh you can take may be two bus stops away ***next*** is the singapore river ***next*** so i'm gonna suggest you go and walk along the river bank ***next*** you can have al fresco dining ***next*** 
hum ***next*** i am not so uptodate with music ***next*** but you can move along the various bars ***next*** uh some of them are sports bars that might interest you ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh you can start at boat quay and walk down towards clarke quay ***next*** or you can visit the merlion by the singapore river ***next*** okay so ***next*** 
you get to the merlion ***next*** and so i think if it's early enough you might to want to ***next*** take a photograph of the merlion first ***next*** and then have your dinner along boat quay or clarke quay ***next*** 
and i suggest you buy a package ticket ***next*** so it is uh cheaper for you for the entrance fees ***next*** when you say package how many people are supposed to be in there ***next*** oh no ***next*** 
say you entered the zoo and then next day you enter the bird park and you're buying individual tickets ***next*** you are paying more ***next*** so if you decide where you want to go and then you uh buy the ticket on your first visit ***next*** then you hold on to the ticket and on the next ***next*** 
you are paying more ***next*** so if you decide where you want to go and then you uh buy the ticket on your first visit ***next*** then you hold on to the ticket and on the next ***next*** at the next park you just present the same ticket ***next*** 
yah ***next*** um hm yah ***next*** but the wildlife reserves the parks um this have to be done over the counter ***next*** yes ***next*** 
um hm yah ***next*** but the wildlife reserves the parks um this have to be done over the counter ***next*** yes ***next*** unless you buy from a travel age~ ***next*** 
i know you're expecting something else ***next*** okay ***next*** uh look ***next*** can you see the great rift valley of ethiopia ***next*** 
is the place well lit ***next*** at night ***next*** uh you can get in earlier to have your dinner ***next*** so i'm suggesting you go to the zoo in the afternoon ***next*** 
it's re ***next*** yes ***next*** uh it's somebody who's walking on a rope just above your heads ***next*** so uh again i'm not gonna tell you ***next*** 
okay ***next*** that seems reasonable ***next*** you see up here ***next*** if you're visiting only the night safari ***next*** 
or you suggested that we go through uh dinner first ***next*** and then go back for the night safari ***next*** yah ***next*** e~ ***next*** 
but i'm planning of visiting the country ***next*** and if i'm not mistaken you're a great and good tourist guide ***next*** so can you help me with this tour ***next*** sure ***next*** 
few roads that i mentioned uh will gives you very good uh photo opportunities ***next*** because the streets are beautifully decorated uh to remember or to celebrate these special days ***next*** and of course in december we light up the whole street of orchard road right up to the marina area ***next*** and again with a christmas theme ***next*** 
not that they don't clean the houses ***next*** but they do very thorough cleaning of their houses as well as ***next*** uh prepare their house for a visits by their relatives and friends ***next*** so they would buy a food like for example special cookies that they may not eat for the rest of the year ***next*** 
uh but do they have any kind of a special cuisine or ***next*** in that festival are they allowed to eat ***next*** yes ***next*** the uh muslims will only do fasting before hari raya puasa alright ***next*** 
but after they break their fast everyday uh in the evening ***next*** usually at about seven plus in the evening ***next*** uh five plus seven plus depending on the uh moon uh they will be able to eat ***next*** and once day break they will uh start to fast their fast again ***next*** 
uh but otherwise most of the other time i would think that because of the uh western ***next*** uh modern influences ***next*** well the indian ladies today would also be wearing the normal kind of uh clothes that any other lady in the world would be wearing ***next*** alright the modern kind of dressing ***next*** 
sure no problem ***next*** okay let me just ***next*** and ***next*** yes ***next*** 
oh yes uh ***next*** okay now ***next*** yes the image for the sari ***next*** this is quite a modern uh ***next*** 
this is quite a modern uh ***next*** yah version of the sari ***next*** you can see now on the screen ***next*** okay let me just go ***next*** 
uh there is no ti ***next*** uh and there's no zip or buttons on the sari ***next*** the bottom part the skirt ***next*** so it's a matter of wrapping uh around the waist ***next*** 
it's like wrapping okay ***next*** yah ***next*** and the ladies wear them with a short uh blouse ***next*** yes so you see um this ***next*** 
wearing a traditional costume ***next*** yes ***next*** uh quite a lot of our indian ladies today they would still try to wear traditional clothings ***next*** especially when it comes to um uh major festivals ***next*** 
it's because uh the indians in their home they would like to light this um incense ***next*** and uh a candle uh in this incense ***next*** uh candle holder ***next*** in their home ***next*** 
uh candle holder ***next*** in their home ***next*** and basically in short it's actually a festival to celebrate the triumph of good over evil ***next*** uh so this is all this festival is all about ***next*** 
well uh ***next*** yes ***next*** the indians would visit uh their relatives and friends ***next*** and of course they get to uh eat ***next*** 
you see ***next*** uh if they do not have time they can always buy them uh from the hote~ ***next*** uh from the restaurants ***next*** or buy them from cafes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh this will be the celebration for christmas ***next*** well in singapore whatever races or uh belief uh that we come from ***next*** uh everybody else i think celebrate christmas here in singapore ***next*** 
really ***next*** from the airport ***next*** yah ***next*** uh no not from the airport alright ***next*** 
orchard road is like the main city of singapore ***next*** or ***next*** i wouldn't say the uh main city ***next*** uh it is like the main uh shopping belt in singapore ***next*** 
the whole street of orchard road is lighted up ***next*** so that's why i say you walk and you um enjoy the lights ***next*** and lots of bus ***next*** uh photo opportunities ***next*** 
like party in the streets ***next*** or they do have drinking occasions something like that ***next*** uh yes we do have ***next*** uh on the christmas day uh christmas eve we ***next*** 
no way ***next*** yes ***next*** so and uh ***next*** yes we have a street party out here ***next*** 
no i'm just kidding ***next*** you mean ***next*** so ***next*** okay ***next*** 
so ***next*** okay ***next*** orchard road itself is about uh three kilometres long ***next*** so every other building would be a shopping mall or hotel ***next*** 
in fact ***next*** okay ***next*** we don't have uh three star hotel in orchard road ***next*** we do have four star ***next*** 
differences like amenities ***next*** okay ***next*** uh all the three hotels they have full amenities ***next*** so they have breakfast available in the morning ***next*** 
or usually local ***next*** yes ***next*** yes ***next*** it's a mix ***next*** 
we have quite a lot of the uh ***next*** march ***next*** more on musical ***next*** yah ***next***

so good ***next*** well one of our very popular food in uh singapore would be chili crab pepper crab ***next*** uh but it's not ***next*** you don't really want to eat with your hands ***next*** 
but if you buy them from the uh malay store owner ***next*** they won't sell pork satay ***next*** uh so this is marinated meat pierced through a skewer the garnishes ***next*** uh would be onions and cucumber ***next*** 
um well i would think that dempsey would be uh just uh off orchard road ***next*** uh you will have to walk if you really want to walk ***next*** it's about twentyfive minutes ***next*** and it's a little bit up slope and down slope ***next*** 
remember just now you saw the bay ***next*** okay ***next*** so you just walk back a little bit uh on the three uh line ***next*** and you're still walking on the bay ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** so that's ***next*** yah it looks like porcupine right ***next*** yah it looks like porcupine right ***next***

let's scroll down again ***next*** and see whether we get the merlion ***next*** yes ***next*** okay ***next*** 
because the shops are owned by pretty young entrepreneurs ***next*** and the kind of products they carry uh would be one of its kind ***next*** so you don't find them in uh our shopping mall ***next*** so they basically have just one shop ***next*** 
and the kind of products they carry uh would be one of its kind ***next*** so you don't find them in uh our shopping mall ***next*** so they basically have just one shop ***next*** if you know you are not into shopping ***next***

smoking flavoured water ***next*** that sounds good ***next*** and we're supposed to be doing some kind of sport there ***next*** uh what ***next*** 
but not today ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next***

yah you called it a plate ***next*** i called it a spaceship ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so this is the new supreme court ***next*** okay ***next*** 
where is that ***next*** uh parliament house ***next*** okay ***next*** it's all within the vinicity of this rectangular uh greenfield ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** that sad ***next*** so there's a little bit of uh restriction going into the parliament house ***next*** otherwise the one that i showed you just now the uh supreme court ***next*** 
yap ***next*** okay ***next*** yes i agree ***next*** but ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yes i agree ***next*** but ***next*** yes ***next*** 
we called it the singapore uh cruises ***next*** and this boat plies on the singapore river ***next*** uh hm okay ***next*** it is a half an hour ride ***next*** 
um and that's how singapore get rich in the early days ***next*** because this was our port ***next*** so uh ***next*** yes on the boat you will get to have an idea how people used to live along the river ***next*** 
she would probably shop 'til she drops ***next*** if you know what i mean ***next*** okay ***next*** so after your boat cruise uh what you could do is you bring her back to the ***next*** 
so after your boat cruise uh what you could do is you bring her back to the ***next*** again if you don't want to go too far away from where you are ***next*** you could just do a very small area ***next*** then you go to the shopping centre called uh raffles city ***next*** 
branded stuff midrange ***next*** and if that is not enough still she can go to the underground ***next*** and do uh some serious shopping again ***next*** the underground city mall ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so that's a lots of shopping uh options uh available ***next*** and again if you don't want to get too far away ***next*** but if you want to see a little bit more then of course you can always go back to the orchard road ***next*** 
alright ***next*** yes ***next*** and some of the store do serve them with a piece of banana uh leaf at the bottom ***next*** and then you can see there's a lime for you to make the dish a little bit sour ***next*** 
and some of the store do serve them with a piece of banana uh leaf at the bottom ***next*** and then you can see there's a lime for you to make the dish a little bit sour ***next*** of course the chili will be a little hot ***next*** um yah something a little bit unique out here uh in singapore ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh all the restaurant ***next*** chinese restaurant would be able to serve you these dishes ***next*** it's quite a common uh food uh that a lot of the locals like to eat ***next*** 
you would actually need more time here ***next*** but uh if you have just two days um ***next*** yes this is uh maybe something that i would be able to recommend you ***next*** based on your requirements ***next*** 
well your coming here of course the highlight ***next*** most important one would be your proposal ***next*** a little bit of sightseeing ***next*** a little bit of relaxation ***next*** 
crazy ***next*** they're going crazy ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh that would be don rommell ***next*** and rommell is okay ***next*** okay ***next*** 
thank you ***next*** bye ***next*** okay ***next*** bye ***next*** 
good afternoon ***next*** hi i'm ***next*** good afternoon ***next*** i'm jeanne and i am guide number two ***next*** 
for the both of us ***next*** that should include our meals our trips and everything ***next*** okay ***next*** um so maybe i gave you a hotel that's not so expensive ***next*** 
uh actually it's a ***next*** you save money and you save time in the sense that ***next*** you don't have to wait for people to pick you out ***next*** it's more exciting also because you see the locals ***next*** 
so where you get this little round dots that joint up ***next*** are the intersections of the different lines ***next*** i'm ***next*** when you come in you are at number three ***next*** 
is going to that park for free ***next*** and ***next*** yo ***next*** yes it's for free all the time ***next*** 
just a minute uh ***next*** hm okay ***next*** okay maybe this one is very accessible ***next*** this is also on the bay ***next*** 
from your hotel ***next*** it depends if you're going during peak hours in the morning ***next*** there's a surcharge ***next*** but it should not be more than ten dollars ***next*** 
is the ninth a weekend or a weekday ***next*** i believe that's a monday ***next*** so the ninth yes it's a monday ***next*** and you're checking out ***next*** 
yap ***next*** uh i think it's still ***next*** would that be possible ***next*** i think it's still dark ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay ***next*** let me get your hotel for you ***next*** so you okay with chinatown ***next*** 
because they occupy what used to be shophouses ***next*** and uh hotels what they do is they uh ***next*** the owners buy up several uh units of these of shophouses ***next*** and convert them into hotels ***next*** 
not much of a budget ***next*** 'cause as you know um this will be a honeymoon for us ***next*** so of course um staying at the hotel would also be part of our adventure ***next*** okay ***next*** 
no we don't have the size ***next*** uh our golf courses are separates uh usually ***next*** oh it's separate ***next*** ah yes ***next*** 
just of course we're gonna watch some things some shows ***next*** and um i think we don't have much time to watch some shows ***next*** oh i'm not suggesting you watch shows ***next*** i'm just suggesting you have a look at the place uh ***next*** 
i'm just suggesting you have a look at the place uh ***next*** and take photos uh ***next*** because you are looking out at the marina bay sands hotel ***next*** which is quite iconic and the uh bay right in front of the singapore river ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so you know it as the durian also huh ***next*** no i just thought that it looks like a durian ***next*** yes it does look like a durian ***next*** 
well i can deal with that ***next*** i don't think my husband will be very happy about that ***next*** well he can play golf you know ***next*** he is a fit ***next*** 
well he can play golf you know ***next*** he is a fit ***next*** so uh if you did it at seven in the morning it's very nice ***next*** i have done it once before ***next*** 
would you like to take a boat home ***next*** you know ***next*** from the merlion you can board a boat ***next*** uh these are electric boats that ply the bay and the river ***next*** 
let me check out one fullerton uh where ***next*** see if they have anything that what ***next*** is what i would consider singapore food huh ***next*** the one fullerton areas for food ***next*** 
palm beach ***next*** so ***next*** so you can get crabs there ***next*** you can get a uh ***next*** 
oh if you do street shopping ***next*** then it's a bit warm ***next*** but if you're going to the shopping malls uh ***next*** let me try and get you ***next*** 
is the singapore history museum ***next*** uh this one will give you uh only singapore ***next*** the history around the river ***next*** that means the early history of singapore and what went on by the uh ***next*** 
so there is uh or i don't know whether you can call it a museum ***next*** but when you enter ***next*** it gives you the history of singapore in fact and the development along the rivers ***next*** uh all the rivers ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yap so i'm left with four hundred ***next*** so you have uh ***next*** four hun~ ***next*** 
i'm going to shop ***next*** so perhaps shopping would be around two hundred ***next*** two hundred three ***next*** two hundred ***next*** 
okay we got the menu for you here and should have a price there ***next*** can you read it ***next*** the price not really clear for me ***next*** you can't see the price ***next*** 
so you see if you don't order of full meal ***next*** from salad soup main meal and then have a dessert and coffee ***next*** it wouldn't cost you so much ***next*** it's ***next*** 
and the ambiance is good ***next*** i don't know what that hotel or what that place is ***next*** but um i have seen pictures of a floating building ***next*** and it's ***next*** 
no jeanne ***next*** thank you very much ***next*** i'll see you in singapore then ***next*** okay ***next*** 
hello ***next*** hello i'm participant number thirty ***next*** my name is amil ***next*** emile e m i l e ***next*** 
uh your age group are you in your twenties or thirties ***next*** oh twenty five ***next*** okay ***next*** um do you have fix dates for coming or are you open ***next***

not like ***next*** not such as beach ***next*** i'm open also for amusements um different tourist spot in singapore ***next*** okay ***next*** 
but first thing on my mind is beach ***next*** okay ***next*** so here you are looking at uh view of the beach front side of the island ***next*** which is off the ***next*** 
so this is the sentosa island ***next*** from sentosa island ***next*** yes ***next*** sentosa island and you can easily get across ***next*** 
from sentosa island ***next*** yes ***next*** sentosa island and you can easily get across ***next*** by shuttle bus that is provided by the la~ ***next*** 
by shuttle bus that is provided by the la~ ***next*** okay ***next*** shuttle buses ***next*** yes ***next*** 
because i want to ***next*** siloso beach ***next*** uh siloso beach ***next*** i don't know how it got its' name ***next*** 
yah but uh normally they play frisbee right ***next*** uh yes frisbee also ***next*** yes on the beach ***next*** definitely frisbee ***next*** 
okay ***next*** okay ***next*** so i see dolphins ***next*** yes yah ***next*** 
fish oh ***next*** ah okay ***next*** so it's like um ocean park here in the philippines ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** uh i haven't been to ocean park but uh ***next*** if you have the same technology now i think they have the same idea ***next*** in other parts of the world ***next*** 
in other parts of the world ***next*** but uh when it first opened ***next*** uh we were told that singapore was the first one ***next*** so where you see the uh ***next*** 
wildlife yah ***next*** wildlife okay ***next*** i'll get out of this and uh we'll go to ***next*** one of my favourite places ***next*** 
the birds are flying all around you ***next*** okay ***next*** so you're actually inside the aviary ***next*** and these feeding trace are very near the path where you walk ***next*** 
and you see the waterfall at the back of this picture ***next*** yes beautiful ***next*** yes it's very nice place for photography ***next*** so two of you going you can stand there and take photographs ***next*** 
she volunteered yah ***next*** yes you uh ***next*** this one you know uh she's uh probably a park worker ***next*** because they used her for the advertisement ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay she volunteered it for commercial purposes ***next*** no she is a park uh staff ***next*** i know her ***next*** 
uh that is like the latest attraction you know ***next*** ah so this is the latest attraction ***next*** so ***next*** yes because i haven't seen it myself ***next*** 
for the wildlife ***next*** yes ***next*** so i saw a giant elephants ***next*** so ***next*** 
hm not yet ***next*** uh it's a little bit bumpy ***next*** uh so the rides are not extensive ***next*** you know what i mean ***next*** 
so different restaurants ***next*** uh it's a different restaurant ***next*** that we can choose ***next*** uh this is a programme only in the morning ***next*** 
uh it's a different restaurant ***next*** that we can choose ***next*** uh this is a programme only in the morning ***next*** where you can take photographs uh with the orangutan ***next*** 
uh you don't have this programme available ***next*** but we have restaurants within the zoo ***next*** in airconditioned areas if you think it's too hot ***next*** or you may want to sit outside ***next*** 
in airconditioned areas if you think it's too hot ***next*** or you may want to sit outside ***next*** so there is uh ***next*** can you see the list of restaurants there ***next*** 
pizzafari ***next*** so ***next*** so that's a pizza joint ***next*** there's a ***next*** 
so because ***next*** so this restaurant built um two years ago ***next*** no this restaurant no was built much longer ***next*** but it has been furbished ***next*** 
and then you go to ***next*** okay ***next*** bird park in the morning ***next*** yes ***next*** 
along ***next*** you ***next*** the tram that is uh painted like a tiger ***next*** it can bring you around the zoo ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so is this uh also the only the pictures of malayan tapir and giraffe ***next*** so is there any pictures of animals ***next*** okay let ***next*** 
and yes the pictures keep changing we can't control that ***next*** yes ***next*** uh so you can see the elephants ***next*** so this is a depiction of the tribes doing the dance with fire ***next*** 
like carrying a snake ***next*** yes ***next*** uh it depends on your size you know ***next*** there wo~ ***next*** 
so the whole night safari is divided into zones ***next*** so on the right side you can see the different zones ***next*** so as you pass by you'd be able to see these animals ***next*** okay ***next*** 
yes ***next*** in the day zoo you see the white tigers ***next*** white tigers ***next*** have you heard of ***next*** 
yes that's right ***next*** uh yes different countries different continents uh ***next*** it sounds great because this is educational also ***next*** yes ***next*** 
i'll just pay five dollars ***next*** yes five dollars ***next*** you buy the ticket ***next*** in other words you decide at the time that you are buying the ticket ***next*** 
because it's just along the beach ***next*** you can just walk down the beach ***next*** okay ***next*** see it's on a hill overlooking siloso beach ***next*** 
it's like a regular resort ***next*** you just booked the rooms there ***next*** okay so how much is it ***next*** can you see the price here ***next*** 
so i guess it depends on the time ***next*** okay so this is offpeak ***next*** yah it depends on the time you go ***next*** let me see whether i can get ***next*** 
okay ***next*** sentosa ***next*** the third one from your left ***next*** just wait ***next*** 
so five to six you're staying one night is that right ***next*** yah yes ***next*** okay so let's check out the prices ***next*** you have to be ***next*** 
uh so one room with uh twin beds or double beds ***next*** oh you need to stay two nights ***next*** shall we check out the ***next*** you have lots of money so you can stay two nights huh ***next*** 
let say it's a big um figure ***next*** you will get your change back for taking the uh mass rapid transit ***next*** to travel around by train and the bus ***next*** so allow thirty dollars per person ***next*** 
bye ***next*** bye bye amil ***next*** bye bye ***next*** bye bye ***next*** 
um i'm not quite sure if my budget would be enough ***next*** could you give the suggestions so i could be able to maximise my budget ***next*** your budget is more than enough for ***next*** because two days is only one night ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay and you are in your twenties i assume ***next*** actually i'm in my thirties ***next*** oh you sounded a very young thirty then okay ***next*** 
that would be great also ***next*** okay ***next*** okay the city lights uh the architecture is very uh accessible from the island ***next*** because uh this island is off the south of singapore and it's also uh you know ***next*** 
alright ***next*** which is also integrated with the bus system uh at bus interchanges at there ***next*** there are lots of people using public transport ***next*** so it's very easy to move around in singapore ***next*** 
yes uh in fact i suggest you take the train because it's faster and it's uh ***next*** is it cheaper ***next*** uh actually travel is by distance ***next*** so by distance the trains are more expensive to set up ***next*** 
and that is our airport international airport ***next*** so if you come in here and you go down to the basement ***next*** there is an office that will sell you the tickets for the subway ***next*** and you can put value in it ***next*** 
and you also don't ***next*** you also get a discount ***next*** every time you connect the journey uh you'll get a discount ***next*** so it makes it very attractive ***next*** 
and tap it at uh when you come out the gate will open when you are on the subway ***next*** and if you are in the bus you must remember to tap it when you get off the bus ***next*** because otherwise uh the system will assume that you've taken the journey right up to the end ***next*** because they are not reading anything on your card ***next*** 
and if you are in the bus you must remember to tap it when you get off the bus ***next*** because otherwise uh the system will assume that you've taken the journey right up to the end ***next*** because they are not reading anything on your card ***next*** so you tap in and you tap out ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** oh so it's so there is an extra charge if i'll uh i'm going to buy it seven eleven ***next*** no it's not extra you're just putting value into the card ***next*** so uh this makes it convenient because seven eleven stores are all over singapore ***next*** 
so uh this makes it convenient because seven eleven stores are all over singapore ***next*** uh even at petrol stations ***next*** so you ***next*** if you should run out of money in the card ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah ***next*** yah ***next*** um so where do you want to live in singapore ***next*** 
where do you want to stay ***next*** uh so you want a beach hotel or you want to stay in an ethnic area ***next*** uh can you explain me what can i see in an ethnic area ***next*** okay ethnic area we have two uh that is uh very easily uh connectable for you ***next*** 
yah so if you want to have a room to yourself ***next*** about eighty to a hundred sixty uh you should be able to get a decent size uh room in chinatown ***next*** that's per night right ***next*** yes per night yes ***next*** 
uh i'm really not into the exotic food so i'd like to ***next*** place just that um safe food ***next*** not the exotic ones ***next*** safe food so ***next*** 
safe food so ***next*** in ***next*** uh safe food so do you have chinese food in your country ***next*** uh so ***next*** 
uh we have also new bridge road which is also along the main road uh ***next*** santa grand hundred and forty eight ***next*** and santa grand has two hotels one they call it chinatown hundred and forty eight ***next*** and lai chun yuen which is hundred and forty five ***next*** 
and below a hundred keong saik hotel ***next*** it takes his name from the road ***next*** uh the quieter side of town ***next*** on the quieter side also at the bottom we have scarlet hotel but you can see the price it's two six five ***next*** 
it is a ***next*** it's luxury class ***next*** yes it's luxury class yah ***next*** so uh porcelain hotel is on the main road ***next*** 
uh quieter side of chinatown is keong saik street ***next*** uh temple street you are actually uh in the heart of ***next*** uh where people eat and uh shop ***next*** so it's like you go downstairs and there are shops all around ***next*** 
if you want to book alright ***next*** uh when are you deciding to come ***next*** um probably on the first week of april ***next*** first week of april ***next*** 
yah one hundred so about twelve dollars more ***next*** um that's okay ***next*** uh that's okay ***next*** uh you look at the price here ***next*** 
um that's okay ***next*** uh that's okay ***next*** uh you look at the price here ***next*** so whether you are by yourself or with your friend it's the same price ***next*** 
but uh for the majority of the hotels they are made up of buildings ***next*** where peopl used to live upstairs and they run a business downstairs ***next*** and it's like it's the same as your hotel although i haven't check up on this particular address ***next*** so the hoteliers un undertook a conservation of the building by restoring it and ***next*** 
and it's like it's the same as your hotel although i haven't check up on this particular address ***next*** so the hoteliers un undertook a conservation of the building by restoring it and ***next*** so the inside was changed ***next*** uh previously uh there was one staircase leading down ***next*** 
so it's quite a bargain for a hundred and thirty dollars right ***next*** and from that little table and chair they have tried to put some of the older furniture ***next*** which has become very popular nowadays huh ***next*** so you can see the room has got a bathroom attached ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** it is uh ***next*** uh i don't know whether you can call it a jam ***next*** it is made of uh coconut ***next*** 
you can see it there uh a shop that is very well known called yakun to ***next*** kaya toast um hm ***next*** yah ***next*** uh let me show you the picture here ***next*** 
they use quality uh dark soy sauce and if you like you can put in a lot of pepper ***next*** yes ***next*** yes ***next*** uh i like to swallow the yolk whole and that's yes ***next*** 
oh yes well i don't eat that everyday uh just a treat once in a while ***next*** and uh you ***next*** so to finish up you can have the kaya on toast ***next*** so you have it's like a desert you know what i mean ***next*** 
and uh you ***next*** so to finish up you can have the kaya on toast ***next*** so you have it's like a desert you know what i mean ***next*** so you have the savoury eggs and then you have the sweet toast ***next*** 
without spending too much so they will uh ask for ice cream toast kaya toast or butter sugar ***next*** have you tried that ***next*** butter sugar toast ***next*** you butter the toast bread and then you sprinkle sugar on it ***next*** 
you can find them along the roadsides you know where you're shopping ***next*** uh because it's a chain ***next*** the family has uh opened up many outlets all over ***next*** yah so uh what else would you like me to find for you uh ***next*** 
that looks like a good deal ***next*** but uh i would also like to have other options ***next*** uh what's the other place that you uh say ***next*** so you want the hotels in little india ***next*** 
okay ***next*** i see that there are no prices included in this page ***next*** okay there are two we can look at ***next*** there is costa sands and there is also siloso beach ***next*** 
or do you want to go another day in april ***next*** how about april seventh ***next*** which da~ ***next*** april seventh okay we'll try for april seventh ***next*** 
right ***next*** so it's saturday till monday ***next*** so you have the weekend there ***next*** oh i'm sorry they have no room ***next*** 
let's try another date ***next*** do you want to get okay ***next*** uh wait ***next*** you try another date further down in april ***next*** 
uh but you see the deluxe room that's a deluxe room that you are seeing over there ***next*** okay ***next*** so that is the difference ***next*** some people prefer that uh they go to the uh kampong hut ***next*** 
and also some people uh they like to have the sea breezes ***next*** i used to do that when i was uh in school ***next*** so you open the windows and you can hear the water ***next*** you can hear uh the crickets in the background you know ***next*** 
so uh the kampong hut would be very attractive for me ***next*** uh i mean if i were the visitor ***next*** but if you prefer creature comforts you need your air conditioning ***next*** then uh the hotel room will be more the regular type of hotel that you will be able to enjoy ***next*** 
could you click back ***next*** yes ***next*** so here it is ***next*** they didn't mention air conditioning ***next*** 
i don't know why it doesn't say whether it's airconditioned or not ***next*** but you see it's all closed in ***next*** you get what i mean ***next*** so um ***next*** 
probably it is ***next*** yes probably it is ***next*** uh so uh you still get your air conditioning but i think the size of the place ***next*** is perhaps a little bit smaller ***next*** 
we have to share ***next*** so you'll ***next*** yes you have to share ***next*** so in fact the room isn't that small because you can have two doubledecker beds ***next*** 
and that means if you came with three other friends ***next*** you'll still be able to stay there ***next*** um hm ***next*** so some people on tight budget that's what they'll do ***next*** 
what sort of things that would you like to see whilst you're here ***next*** uh are there botanical gardens in singapore ***next*** oh yes uh we have a botanic gardens that is very wellknown ***next*** and sentosa also has greenery all around ***next*** 
uh i'll get you the information on the botanic gardens ***next*** it's the singapore botanic gardens ***next*** okay ***next*** and uh it's a huge place and most people uh ***next*** 
so it's quite comfortable ***next*** and we have also a ginger garden within the area ***next*** and these areas are very near to each other ***next*** so ginger's uh consist of eight families and some of them ***next*** 
they go there and they jog and uh ***next*** so it's nice also to have a look at other things besides the flowers there ***next*** and we have you know senior citizens it's only one dollar ***next*** this is only if you see the orchids ***next*** 
nuts and fruits ***next*** uh not nuts and fruits but uh souvenirs like ***next*** but within the national orchid garden uh we have a company called risis ***next*** it i~ ***next*** 
but the landscaping is more towards the natural environment of the inhabitants ***next*** so like here were plants um fruit trees for the birds ***next*** and tall shady trees and where the same trees are found in africa and can survive in singapore ***next*** we also got them ***next*** 
have breakfast and at the same time you can ***next*** after your breakfast take a photograph with the orangutan ***next*** they actually pose for pictures ***next*** uh they don't really pose they are sitting there ***next*** 
and uh i haven't seen an orangutan smile ***next*** uh but ***next*** yes i know ***next*** uh if you are lucky there is a baby and then you can see uh the mother and the baby ***next*** 
uh but ***next*** yes i know ***next*** uh if you are lucky there is a baby and then you can see uh the mother and the baby ***next*** so if their baby is there don't touch the baby ***next*** 
you know mothers are naturally protective of the babies ***next*** just kidding ***next*** yes ***next*** so this is bigger picture ***next*** 
just kidding ***next*** yes ***next*** so this is bigger picture ***next*** so the orangutan is nearby but it doesn't care for your jam and rolls ***next*** 
yes ***next*** so this is bigger picture ***next*** so the orangutan is nearby but it doesn't care for your jam and rolls ***next*** and it will have fruits like uh bananas durian ***next*** 
this is a very handsome python called the golden python ***next*** and it's with the handler so uh if you ***next*** uh do you like snakes or are you ***next*** uh do you like snakes or are you ***next*** 
that's what some of my tourist do ***next*** uh sorry not cobra i said the wrong thing ***next*** phy ***next*** yes no cobra sorry ***next*** 
here we go ***next*** so you are looking at all the animals ***next*** this is a family of orangutans ***next*** we have crocodiles and monitor lizards ***next*** 
it's a big area and as you're walking around you can take photographs of these animals yah ***next*** and these are fellows from africa uh baboons himalayan hamadryas baboons ***next*** we also have polar bears and there's a polar bear show ***next*** so this one looks like the singaporean polar bear who was born here ***next*** 
and these are fellows from africa uh baboons himalayan hamadryas baboons ***next*** we also have polar bears and there's a polar bear show ***next*** so this one looks like the singaporean polar bear who was born here ***next*** so he has airconditioned surroundings yah ***next*** 
hm yes ***next*** yes uh ***next*** okay show one more to tempt you further ***next*** this is uh the most popular attraction because it is very rare ***next*** 
so we have uh special pricing with discount built in ***next*** if you visit two attractions uh you get a discount ***next*** see if you visit the zoo alone that is twenty dollars ***next*** do you see there ***next*** 
yes correct ***next*** so that's it ***next*** uh yes that's right ***next*** yah ***next*** 
you're very welcome jen and look forward to seeing you and your friend ***next*** alright ***next*** see you soon ***next*** alright bye ***next*** 
bye ***next*** bye ***next*** bye ***next*** yes goodbye can you hear me ***next*** 
uh that's the september period ***next*** uh you will be at the formula one to watch the races ***next*** so i think it's better if i get you uh attractions that are near the formula one venue ***next*** ah but uh do you want to settle where you want to live first where you want to stay ***next*** 
yup ***next*** um i think the first or the second one ***next*** uh the beach hotel or the park view hotel would be great ***next*** yes ***next*** 
so let see if uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds ***next*** okay ***next*** september ***next*** you want to come in on the twenty first ***next*** 
um i'll check my uh tickets ***next*** i think that's gonna be on the twenty first early uh part of the day ***next*** like um around eight o'clock in the morning ***next*** uh yes that's ideal ***next*** 
so let's have a look ***next*** um okay ***next*** we have to wait for the response and see if they have rooms or uh what sort of price ***next*** they have put there normally that's uh you know ***next*** 
and if i walk the same distance ***next*** because when i go by bus my bus stop somewhere near there ***next*** and uh there you can get uh local food ***next*** uh i'm not sure if i can get you ***next*** 
uh around the hotel also uh there are places that you can come out and eat ***next*** and if you want something in an airconditioned place ***next*** there's also a food centre uh nearby at raffles city ***next*** which is a big convention and exhibition centre ***next*** 
but you know many people work there and uh ***next*** they can't afford to be you know going out to markets to look for food ***next*** so at these food centres you'll get decent food local food ***next*** and at affordable prices ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** alright ***next*** so our version of it here in uh southeast asia is satay ***next*** we called it s a t a y ***next*** 
uh there are other spicy dishes i can introduce you ***next*** these are more sweet ***next*** they are usually marinated to be sweet ***next*** and the sauce is peanut sauce gravy ***next*** 
yah ***next*** and you eat it with rice ***next*** that has been cooked and ***next*** traditionally they used leaves to weave a little basket to cook it ***next*** 
um i like what i'm seeing ***next*** yah ***next*** okay on the last picture here on the ***next*** at the top ***next*** 
i always recommend that it's finger licking good ***next*** wow ***next*** okay i really don't mind ***next*** um yah ***next*** 
we'll try and cancel this ***next*** yah that's ***next*** yah no problem ***next*** alright okay ***next*** 
yah ***next*** okay ***next*** we have got uh ***next*** this level one is about the area where the flyer is ***next*** 
but ***next*** and what do they ***next*** uh do they have lots of mixes there ***next*** yes ***next*** 
i believe you have a great big zoo ***next*** um somewhere ***next*** um the other side i think uh ***next*** yes we have a zoo ***next*** 
um somewhere ***next*** um the other side i think uh ***next*** yes we have a zoo ***next*** it is out of town ***next*** 
so it's also a good opportunity for you to see the type of housing singaporeans live in ***next*** the scenery of you know the natural neighbourhoods that you see ***next*** you will not be in the business area when you take this bus ***next*** that connects you uh from the uh train station to the bu~ ***next*** 
alright ***next*** they are ***next*** they do ***next*** uh the show is not doing tricks it's just ***next*** 
here we have some baboons ***next*** they are hamadryas baboons ***next*** so the environment is not forest it's like hilly ***next*** they have multiplied a lot and don't be afraid if they come at you ***next*** 
they are very strong ***next*** but once in the zoo ***next*** some of them have been bred here ***next*** they are singapore citizens ***next*** 
they are singapore citizens ***next*** hm really ***next*** so ***next*** uh at the breakfast show you can take photographs with them ***next*** 
and the thing is um you see this uh nose hanging down ***next*** wow ***next*** for the male the nose grows long it hangs down ***next*** and for some reason the females think the longer the nose the handsomer he is ***next*** 
and for some reason the females think the longer the nose the handsomer he is ***next*** oh okay ***next*** okay so that's how they classify who's handsome who's not ***next*** uh yes that's right ***next*** 
and the proboscis therefore refers to the length of the nose ***next*** hm i see ***next*** alright cool ***next*** if they are breeding at the time ***next*** 
uh no they are not shy yah ***next*** lots of tourists have taken photographs of them ***next*** i think they get used to the environment ***next*** you're not going to kidzworld so i will skip that ***next*** 
but they don't just drop right in front of you or right at you ***next*** no they specially select these uh snakes ***next*** so the species is specially selected ***next*** so you you walk on a wooden walkway and ***next*** 
so you you walk on a wooden walkway and ***next*** uh so it's quite fun ***next*** suddenly you make a turn and there you have a snake right on ***next*** you know nearby ***next*** 
uh so it's quite fun ***next*** suddenly you make a turn and there you have a snake right on ***next*** you know nearby ***next*** uh and then you just walk out ***next*** 
okay ***next*** i see ***next*** okay pretty safe ***next*** safe very safe ***next*** 
and you must not leave the zoo without seeing this ***next*** oh nice ***next*** i like this ***next*** this is not the regular tiger ***next*** 
so harbourfront here ***next*** you get off the uh bu~ ***next*** the ***next*** sorry the train ***next*** 
the ***next*** sorry the train ***next*** the bus stop in fact ***next*** and in fact if you wait there there are shuttle buses free of charge ***next*** 
i saw something like uh the transformers uh ride ***next*** is that uh in the uh universal studios ***next*** yes uh but i'm not going to show uh all the rides ***next*** you can just see here ***next*** 
yah ***next*** we also have uh battlestar galactica ***next*** choose your side human versus cylon ***next*** and you have the ***next*** 
we also have uh battlestar galactica ***next*** choose your side human versus cylon ***next*** and you have the ***next*** you engage in the ultimate intergalactic battle between good and evil ***next*** 
okay ***next*** that's nice ***next*** uh that ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so uh offhand now i would not be able to tell you ***next*** but uh if you asked your travel agents uh and ***next*** to source for you or uh we have more time to look into the internet ***next*** 
so uh offhand now i would not be able to tell you ***next*** but uh if you asked your travel agents uh and ***next*** to source for you or uh we have more time to look into the internet ***next*** and we contact uh a clubs or schools that are willing to entertain you then you will be able to ***next*** 
but uh if you asked your travel agents uh and ***next*** to source for you or uh we have more time to look into the internet ***next*** and we contact uh a clubs or schools that are willing to entertain you then you will be able to ***next*** but uh you will not have time i think you know ***next*** 
so if you ***next*** at city hall you can take ***next*** let me see what's the easiest connection well either way ***next*** you can go to dhoby ghaut ***next*** 
is that also where i can get some gadgets um ***next*** uh like phones or uh tablets ***next*** uh phones or tablets ***next*** phones you probably can buy ***next*** 
phones you probably can buy ***next*** i can't tell you exactly the shops but i think i've seen phone shops there ***next*** but if you're talking about information technology ***next*** uh there is a centre in singapore where you have uh a lots of these shops ***next*** 
i like that that's where uh singaporeans go ***next*** i like that that's where uh singaporeans go ***next*** uh so here you are at city hall ***next*** you can in fact walk ***next*** 
oh okay ***next*** so as you walk you get to see more uh uh than you would ***next*** if you uh hop up a bus ***next*** it's not very far ***next*** 
alright ***next*** yah i'd uh ***next*** i think uh i'd like to walk from the hotel to that place ***next*** so in the day before the race you have lots of things to occupy you yah ***next*** 
uh so if you walk a little bit further down here ***next*** you see the singapore river ***next*** uh hm okay ***next*** so the race track is here okay ***next*** 
but um can you remind me again i'm sorry ***next*** uh it's the first emblem of the singapore tourism board when it was started ***next*** half lion and half uh fish ***next*** because we're an island ***next*** 
uh to take photographs as uh you can see some of the tourist there ***next*** uh otherwise if you ***next*** then if you ***next*** after you have taken your photographs you can head back along the river ***next*** 
made of coconut milk and uh sugar and pandanus leaves ***next*** are you familiar with pandanus leaves ***next*** yah uh ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay uh hm ***next*** so we have the description there ***next*** and ya kun here is a very old uh shop with a long history ***next*** and now they have opened little cafés all over singapore ***next*** 
if it is very hot you can settle for ice cream toast ***next*** i think that's a modern addon ***next*** oh okay ***next*** uh the traditional is the kaya toast ***next*** 
i cannot get it done this way ***next*** you know sometimes you get it with these transparent parts that are supposed to be white ***next*** but here uh they are all white ***next*** i think it's the temperature was there ***next*** 
uh as you're walking in that area there is also uh pork ***next*** uh uh what we like to eat is uh pork bones in soup that you can uh try ***next*** and it's also a coffee shop ***next*** just down from the river near to where your stall is ***next*** 
yes ***next*** so it's a spicy ***next*** so they ***next*** normally a lot of restaurants now leave the spicy options to you ***next*** 
so i'll um ***next*** get in touch again maybe uh with the bookings ***next*** so that we can finalise everything ***next*** yes indeed ***next*** 
Empty ***next*** hi good morning ***next*** hi good morning ***next*** uh how can i help you ***next***

animals will be in the zoo ***next*** a zoo will be a nice place to visit as well ***next*** zoo ***next*** yes ***next*** 
usually is about two hours of rest ***next*** they probably will charge you hm approximately around about fifty to sixty dollars ***next*** ninety three ***next*** yah ***next*** 
and that uh the animals are actually are on their own uh premises ***next*** but you doesn't have the feel that it was in a cage ***next*** uh there is a certain things that we have put in place ***next*** so that the animals will not uh escape from their premises ***next***

if you really like the theme park one of them is you know ***next*** universal studio as i recommend ***next*** if not then you probably would like to have the beach ***next*** sentosa also do have some nice beaches as well ***next*** 
yah ***next*** hm i'm planning to um to come with my girlfriend ***next*** while can you suggest some romantic place there ***next*** romantic places ***next*** 
this is the platform that goes up and down ***next*** no ***next*** it's actually a wheel ***next*** a big giant wheel ***next*** 
uh the singapore flyer in fact is standing at the height of one hundred and sixty five metre ***next*** oh my god ***next*** that's too high ***next*** uh no ***next*** 
do they have some water sports there ***next*** uh yes ***next*** we do have some cables ***next*** uh cable skis which is available at that area ***next*** 
uh that's the east coast bridge ***next*** you can also do cycling along the beaches ***next*** cycling ***next*** yah ***next*** 
it's a actually a cable which take them around on the east coast uh lagoon ***next*** wow ***next*** is that wakeboarding or ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh why don't in this way ***next*** maybe on the first day when you arrive ***next*** i would like to say is that hm you can try to stay in a hotel near to uh this ***next*** 
uh ah okay ***next*** um i like to discover more of the universal studios ***next*** can you uh ***next*** okay ***next*** 
uh alright ***next*** uh any other ***next*** some suggestions for any other rides or any ***next*** okay ***next*** 
we have here ***next*** and the ***next*** is there any roller coasters or ***next*** yes of course ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh there you just now you asked about the lost world ***next*** this is the lost world where the ***next*** uh i talked about the dinosaurs and ***next*** 
yes i ***next*** mainly for children ***next*** okay ***next*** uh for elders also for teenagers ***next*** 
it's very cool ***next*** well uh ***next*** so this is the whole theme park of uh universal studio ***next*** in fact it's really required uh one complete full day to be uh completing the whole uh theme park ***next*** 
how about the ***next*** the central lake ***next*** is that a lake or a ***next*** uh this is a small lake yes ***next*** 
i ***next*** yah ***next*** can i get some fish there ***next*** uh sorry ***next*** 
madagascar yes ***next*** the sentosa ***next*** like a hollywood sign there ***next*** uh this one yes ***next*** 
uh approximately about eight thousand visitors a day ***next*** eight thousand a day ***next*** maximum ***next*** yah ***next*** 
uh much issue on that ***next*** uh usually inside universal studio we do have lockers available ***next*** for every attractions there are lockers available ***next*** which is uh for the first half an hour is free ***next*** 
yes ***next*** can you show it to me ***next*** yah i'll show it to you right now ***next*** you see that is the merlion tower ***next*** 
it's the same thing like um a four d movie ***next*** but uh ***next*** the fourth one yah ***next*** yah ***next*** 
no they shoot on the screen so you get uh ***next*** to see who is the ***next*** oh okay ***next*** uh who is the best shooters ***next*** 
who's a good sheriff ***next*** yes ***next*** so on three d use the real guns ***next*** yah ***next*** 
they are using uh ***next*** electronic arcade's guns ***next*** wow ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** the rides ***next*** yes ***next*** in sentosa or you're referring to some other parts of singapore ***next*** 
yah ***next*** or if you want you can probably try this one ***next*** isn't that for lazy people ***next*** not for lazy people it's for attraction ***next*** 
isn't that for lazy people ***next*** not for lazy people it's for attraction ***next*** just kidding ***next*** yah ***next*** 
if you want to see the whole singapore then you have to go to mount faber ***next*** which is taking the cable car ride from there ***next*** or you can also take the singapore flyer ***next*** which you will be ***next*** 
of course not to catch the fish huh but just to touch ***next*** this is the one that you can see on the screen right now ***next*** you can still put your hands in to touch the stingray ***next*** you can even feed the fish if you want ***next*** 
will that do for two days ***next*** uh yes that also depends on uh which hotels you prefer to stay ***next*** in a budget hotel or you prefer to stay a little bit much more premium hotel ***next*** then you probably have less spending then ***next*** 
so that i can you know put you ***next*** put it in a place or hotel whereby near to that place ***next*** you spend less on transportation uh easy access to public transport ***next*** so that ***next*** 
how is the weather like there uh on september ***next*** well in singapore here our weather ***next*** uh the temperature wise ***next*** um maybe from twenty six degree to thirty six degree ***next*** 
well in singapore here our weather ***next*** uh the temperature wise ***next*** um maybe from twenty six degree to thirty six degree ***next*** it's pretty humid here ***next*** 
yes ***next*** yes ***next*** right ***next*** uh bugis street is also quite near to your hotel ***next*** 
slightly much more cheap clothing uh maybe in reasonable price ***next*** uh you can go to bugis village ***next*** because those uh area they sells a lot of um tshirts uh ladies accessories ***next*** uh even for the guys if you need some watches you can pick it up from there ***next*** 
yes it's quite safe uh in singapore ***next*** um in fact nobody uh should bothers you when you are walking along the street ***next*** so long as you know you don't um i mean ***next*** uh during the night time of course uh we will suggest you not to outshine yourself ***next*** 
so in case anything uh really needs ***next*** uh in needs of the medical attention there is also available nearby to your hotel ***next*** so not very far away ***next*** food wise uh for food there's a lot of food courts available along your ***next*** 
not so much of um walking to be done ***next*** so click next on your screen right now you are seeing ***next*** uh it's actually a calendar of universal studio ***next*** now since you are coming in the month of september and it falls on the twentieth ***next*** 
but if you go on the twenty first it will be a little bit more costly now ***next*** because the friday is consider as a weekend rate ***next*** so weekend rate means uh peak rate ***next*** so you'll probably have to pay a fee more expensive ***next*** 
so your daughter is sixteen years old i'm sorry you do not ***next*** uh you are not entitled for the children ***next*** i'll be paying full amount ***next*** right ***next*** 
uh we also do have an express pass which is available ***next*** now this express pass of thirty dollars is addon to your original ticket price of sixty eight dollars ***next*** the express pass means that you ***next*** it actually allows you to access to a shorter queue inside the attraction ***next*** 
ah okay ***next*** oh okay that's fair ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
yah ***next*** okay i got that ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
so only from here you take the sentosa express to the sentosa island ***next*** so it's quite near ***next*** the minute when you come back again after you did universal studio ***next*** you can also drop in in this shopping mall and do your shopping ***next*** 
so it's quite near ***next*** the minute when you come back again after you did universal studio ***next*** you can also drop in in this shopping mall and do your shopping ***next*** before going back to your hotel ***next*** 
yah ***next*** yes i want my trip to be memorable matthew ***next*** okay ***next*** uh if you're going for universal studio if you are buying the express pass ***next*** 
next to the universal studio ***next*** uh you can also enjoy a beach uh show which is very popular in singapore right now ***next*** we call it song of the sea ***next*** song of the sea is actually located in sentosa ***next*** 
so in sentosa you can see um on your screen right now ***next*** okay see the sentosa ***next*** yes ***next*** alright ***next*** 
okay see the sentosa ***next*** yes ***next*** alright ***next*** so sentosa is another uh park whereby uh you can catch the song of the sea in the evening ***next*** 
additional shows only happens during the weekends saturday ***next*** so you can see um the normal ticket is at ten dollars ***next*** so uh you can catch this that particular show before you end your trip ***next*** uh in uh the sentosa ***next*** 
probably you can also visit the underwater world which is located inside sentosa ***next*** but this sentosa underwater world only um opens from the uh nine am to nine pm ***next*** so you have to catch that timing ***next*** it's actually a nice place to be ***next*** 
uh well ***next*** since i only have two days to spare for my vacation ***next*** you see as i say uh there are so many shopping centres around ***next*** uh the place whereby you are putting up is also a nice place for shopping ***next*** 
at that place ***next*** so there are retailer shops actually open at that area ***next*** mainly catered to the indian needs ***next*** not from india ***next*** 
but uh the hotel which you are staying uh near to that particular area ***next*** if you see on the screen now ***next*** you will find that along the street here there is a lot food court or we call it coffee shops available ***next*** coffee shops are uh they sell coffee in the morning ***next*** 
we call it roti prata which is made up of flour ***next*** they fry it on the pan ***next*** and it's quite tasty with ***next*** if you dip it into a curry sauce ***next*** 
yes change everyday ***next*** okay ***next*** it's okay ***next*** yah so you have to check it everyday ***next*** 
uh that will be good enough ***next*** because if you treat singapore as your home ***next*** deffinitely there is no other places that you should ***next*** what you should do and why you should not do ***next*** 
so if you use english as um the communication language ***next*** there shouldn't be a any problem ***next*** even from getting from one place to another ***next*** most of the places are written in english ***next*** 
there shouldn't be a any problem ***next*** even from getting from one place to another ***next*** most of the places are written in english ***next*** it is quite easy to understand ***next*** 
it's approximately around about that time yes ***next*** how about um going back ***next*** will it be difficult to go back to the hotel right after the safari tour ***next*** n~ um ***next*** 
oh that's expensive ***next*** right ***next*** yah ***next*** but otherwise you can just leave a little bit early ***next*** 
how about other places ***next*** what other places can you recommend ***next*** how about um ***next*** well if you like nature singapore botanical garden will be a nice place to visit ***next*** 
going to be around about two dollars per person ***next*** so botanical garden will be a nice place to visit as well ***next*** is it free of charge ***next*** yes botanical garden is free ***next*** 
ah okay ***next*** right ***next*** that is a symbol for singapore right ***next*** ah yes indeed ***next*** 
so there is a fees for you to pay in order to get admission ***next*** again it's five dollars per adults and children have to be below twelve ***next*** again i need to pay five dollars for her as well ***next*** yah ***next*** 
okay ***next*** you're very helpful ***next*** right ***next*** you are most welcome ***next*** 
i hope to see you soon ***next*** and should if you have any more query you can uh ***next*** feel free just to drop by me again ***next*** uh i'm happy to share it with you again yah ***next*** 
Empty ***next*** Empty ***next*** Empty ***next*** hi good morning ***next*** 
uh i'm sorry ***next*** um i didn't mean to uh cut you off there ***next*** uh but what's your name ***next*** my name is mathew i'm the tour guide three ***next*** 
and uh before i proceed i need to find a few things from you ***next*** one is uh what do you have in mind uh when you uh come to singapore ***next*** you like to visit some of the attraction or theme park ***next*** or you prefer to see some nature ***next*** 
alright ***next*** first thing uh i would like to just put it up to you that uh there is a hotel which i'm looking at right now ***next*** which is called hotel eighty one bencoolen ***next*** and this is actually a budget hotel ***next*** 
you can pick it up at the next door where the coffee shop is ***next*** we call it coffee shop is basically because in the early morning and throughout the day ***next*** they do serve coffee tea and you know cakes uh toasted breads ***next*** those things you can get it there at a very cheap rate ***next*** 
well it ***next*** they looks comfortable but i ***next*** to be honest with you i think it's kinda expensive ***next*** yah ***next*** 
so definitely you would not be having uh those kind of facilities uh like the swimming pools and all those staff ***next*** because if you are looking at swimming then you have to ***next*** have a fullfledged hotel or something like a threestar or fourstar hotel ***next*** then you'll have all those facilities ***next*** 
okay but uh can i request them to uh fetch me some food ***next*** yah ***next*** you see uh in singapore here it's quite convenient ***next*** if you are quite hungry and you don't wanna get out from the hotel room ***next*** 
yah ***next*** you see uh in singapore here it's quite convenient ***next*** if you are quite hungry and you don't wanna get out from the hotel room ***next*** you just need to do is to dial uh for their food like mcdonalds uh kentucky fried chicken ***next*** 
but we do reach thirty six sometime ***next*** hm okay ***next*** pretty humid ***next*** yah it's quite humid here ***next*** 
that is the reason why uh it's uh slightly cheaper compared to the hotel that i'm talking about just now ***next*** and you can see there the distance from this hotel uh to the train station ***next*** where i show you about the dhoby ghuat ***next*** it's a little bit further away isn't it ***next*** 
uh it will lead you back to that station which is called the uh dhoby ghaut station ***next*** the only difference is that this is near to only two station ***next*** that is near to three station ***next*** uh i would say four station ***next*** 
so you can ***next*** uh coffee tea uh some sandwiches are there ***next*** uh that's it ***next*** and not like this ***next*** 
yah ***next*** uh um outside of the hotel are there any other uh restaurants that i can choose from ***next*** they ***next*** outside yah ***next*** 
they ***next*** outside yah ***next*** outside your hotel uh there is a chinese restaurant uh across the road ***next*** then if you love indian food indian curry ***next*** 
the whole street there call serangoon road ***next*** in fact is um a place whereby eh uh most of the indian food are sold there ***next*** uh you can of course take a walk there if you want to ***next*** you can see on this part of the area you'll find that um serangoon road ***next*** 
no do you ***next*** can you see the ne seven ***next*** yah i am seeing the map and uh yap serangoon ***next*** yah ye ***next*** 
so i guess uh you had heard about uh uh you said ***next*** just now you were saying that you love uh theme parks right ***next*** yah ***next*** uh so uh the next one that i'm gonna tell you is about a theme park ***next*** 
from your hotel you remember right ***next*** the ne seven ***next*** yah ***next*** now the ne seven will take you all the way up to uh the station here call the harbourfront ***next*** 
harbourfront ***next*** okay if you were to see below uh down here ***next*** you can see northeast line mrt rail okay ***next*** now the northeast line mrt rail ***next*** 
which eh will lead you into universal studio ***next*** is that the train ***next*** yes there is an express train we call it the sentosa express ***next*** if you will take a look here on your map ***next*** 
so from your screen you can see sentosa express ***next*** which is located in vivocity level three ***next*** you can pick up the sentosa express to this station called waterfront station ***next*** this sentosa express only goes into sentosa island ***next*** 
correct ***next*** and then ***next*** no they ***next*** yah approximately yes correct ***next*** 
uh it's another three dollars so six dollars all in all ***next*** and then i would have to uh pay another three dollars for the entrance fee ***next*** that is if i uh i mean that is if i wanted uh a quick ride right ***next*** yah ***next*** 
well of course uh if you choose too um uh okay ***next*** if you choose um to take the pub~ ***next*** direct public buses uh only applies for foreigners ***next*** uh you can pick it up at bencoolen street or bencoolen's road which is quite near to your hotel ***next***

okay ***next*** alright ***next*** alright ***next*** so is walking distance still but uh the option is yours ***next*** 
so right now um i'm trying to uh put up the uh ***next*** i trying to pull up the season chart ***next*** and you can see uh in a while on your screen uh there is a universal studio calendar ***next*** the minute when you see the calendar just uh let me know ***next*** 
uh there will be a huge crowd in the universal studio ***next*** and if you are going on the eighth ***next*** then that will be slightly better ***next*** but then you still face the crowd ***next*** 
and if you are going on the eighth ***next*** then that will be slightly better ***next*** but then you still face the crowd ***next*** uh but of course there is uh the secondary way out for this ***next*** 
the adult fee is seventy four dollars and of course uh you are not senior citizen right ***next*** yah ***next*** okay right ***next*** now the express pass at fifty dollars that means that um ***next*** 
uh yah ***next*** no ***next*** of course and then we also do have the uh if you have watched the movie called the water world ***next*** now that they are there inside this uh small green portion of uh fireworks here ***next*** 
but you can't get any food other than the food court inside there ***next*** so you have to take the food there ***next*** alright ***next*** right ***next*** 
yah of course huh ***next*** he is very popular in his scientific movie ***next*** now in fact for this person to produce a movie he in fact don't create the movie outside ***next*** uh not only outside uh the premises but he created the movie inside a theatre itself ***next***
