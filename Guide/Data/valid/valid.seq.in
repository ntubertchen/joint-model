hello hi good morning
so that you can spend twenty sixth of august here
the hawker food
and- alright maybe i can do a recommendation now
correct
uh you look for the direction that says uh city train
or- okay since it's only one day i think what you can do is you just buy a standard card
uh on this train it's actually uh east-west line
let's say now maybe i'll just talk to you first before i show you the map the city map
the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars uh to- let's say three dollars
or if you're going to stay in near any of the shopping centres uh there's always a money changer in the shopping centre
uh because this is a east-west line um you will have to change uh the line in city hall
because the whole day you'll be out
i'll begin first for breakfast
i would suggest that you come out from the hotel
okay
uh beef uh even sardine
it's a dough they pan fry it
alright
like a teh tarik kind of a tea
uh okay the mrt again uh i would suggest that uh you take a map of the mrt so that you have a better idea how to travel
let me try and get you the uh mrt map
and we have another line the north east line
uh and a circle line
right now these are uh the lines that's available
it's on the green line
okay can you see now
alright
okay
and then you will see city hall
yes just before bugis
yah
a food court is an air-conditioned uh it's a modern version of the non air-conditioned hawker centres
so you can choose like if you want uh just drinks you want chinese food you want fried noodles
and also please remember to pack a change of clothes and also like maybe swimming gear as well
so what you do is like if you are going early in the morning i suggest you go to a short while to the beach
can you see something blinking in the top left corner
okay that is optional
so let's see how you- we you know oh after you-
so you can see uh you know you can basically spend like three quarter of a day or almost a day-
so you can see uh you know you can basically spend like three quarter of a day or almost a day-
yah
yes correct
okay
uh okay
right
and uh because there are so many shops out there that sells similar items so they are pretty- uh i would say very attractive prices
our shops are open until nine thirty
it's different because the quality here uh is better i would say
or you can even uh let's say to save time you can even spe- have your dinner in vivocity
so what you do is when you're finished with sentosa let's say i suggest about five thirty right
uh again-
and then you go on to sentosa let's say at about uh in the afternoon
you'll be in sentosa
but then- yah
uh so while your kids are enjoying and your husband enjoying their time in universal you can go for your spa
yes
yah it's not compulsory
hi this is uh tour guide uh one my name is lynnette and can i get your name
and uh your budget will be in a range of a thousand dollars
just hold on uh-
yah
that's the maximum number ten
alright
so it's fairly easy to get around uh our uh sub- by using the subway and you will save like quite a lot of money instead of taking the taxis
correct
yah
okay
so i think-
you know the mrt uh train station there's always uh office you know you can approach them for help
hm alright
s~
and from there it's just about seven to ten minutes' walk to the hotel
so uh from the city hall it's just about ten minutes i would say to the hotel
so just to do that gallery you need minimum forty five minutes
yah
uh well that will give you an introduction to some of our local food
so you can tour another hour out there okay and this museum used to be located in an old school called saint joseph institution
and of course if you like some relaxation they have uh sauna and fitness centre
yes
and then you can go over to do your museums
and i would definitely also recommend going to sentosa island
yah
we have the parajump jungle trip alright
we have the parajump jungle trip alright
it's on the screen now
so okay you saw the universal now on this screen
uh it's a play
let's say you see the show at seven thirty seven forty and then you come out
you take the uh sentosa express it's a train on sentosa and you can have your dinner over at vivocity
and it's just about uh one km away there's this big wave like shopping centre called vivocity
yes it's a shopping mall there are lots of restaurants there
okay
durian the fruit
alright right
and all the restaurants if you order this dish they always give you a bowl with water and lime or lemon in the water that's not for drinking it's for you to wash your hands
yah
yah
it's just uh inside in the basement area
how much shopping do you want to do uh let say about two hours
so like first day a little bit of walking around uh and again if you want to do some uh- yah i think that would be cover some of your first day
yah
okay
yah
so that is located just off uh orchard road
you can easily spend about two hours
okay
uh o r c h i d s orchids
o r
yes because every other spot is a picture spot
just in singapore okay
so that would be the evening time already
yes because uh you know traditionally we do have ethnic area in singapore so we have like uh chinatown little india and kampong glam
okay
okay chinatown
and if you go to china town do look out for this green colour roof that looks like bamboo
yah
it's all very little cups you know it's like uh what the cups would look like the kind of uh toys when we are small we used to play with this little cups it looks that small
yah it is a small cup so it's actually appreciation
yah it is a small cup so it's actually appreciation
yes
bye
eh okay
are you able to see now
this is okay
you have to get off the train at expo
and you will continue with the green line
the next hotel will be at bugis
that's another word called bras basah
alright
uh but the one at lavender that would be quite a new hotel because they have just opened recently
alright
yes you just need to walk
okay
so do remember to uh check out the audio guides
okay they have various kinds of food
yah
the arabs
yes so what we have done is we have preserved all these ethnic areas
okay
that would be in uh january period
that would be in uh january period
oh
uh right
and again if you like to really learn more about the people in chinatown how- what kind of conditions they were living in
so like one house will be divided into various cubicles and you can have easily uh- fifty people living in just one house on one level
yes so that's something very uh unique i would say
this buddha relic temple is open to the public
uh it's just that they are made to look like bamboos
you can go over to uh little india
and again it's very straightforward the main road of little india is serangoon road
serangoon i'll spell it for you
okay
uh they do have a market
in the basement of the food centre is a market
now in little india the houses are a little bit different
there's also north indian food called chapati
uh about eighty cents for a piece of plain roti prata
okay
and you can wear with uh short uh blouse
when it starts to crack you will just scrape off
flowers mainly
in chinatown uh in little india this one here
so you can choose what you like uh from potatoes to egg to meat
okay like the um uh indian rojak for example
okay it's a sauce called dhal
okay but- okay it's made up of yogurt
so a meal in uh food centre would cost you about- with the uh lassi
okay so the people in little india in the past they used to engage in cattle related activities
there are subtle differences
i would say subtle differences
you can just do the small part alright
you can pick up some traditional games and i think you have played them before possibly when you were young like five stone
yah and then you can have drinks and you can even try this uh shisha
which are very popular in the arab countries
if you buy above a hundred dollars from the same shop
yah the bigger shop that has this gst sign
the small little shops they will not be gst uh registered so they will not be able to uh give you the gst form
okay you can take the uh subway train
alright to go to the east coast area
alright to go to the east coast area
because you have to bring your luggage and all that there
sorry you
in the month of april
okay we have uh depending on the year uh chinese new year usually january where we have this major festival in chinatown
it's appreciation of the moon i would say this festival
you'll see a lot of people offering prayers
uh no major festival like i said in uh april
and how many days were you be spending here
and is there anything in particular that your husband would like to see
uh right now i would say sentosa
and uh coming in from the airport uh
uh and it's quite easy to get around using the subway trains we call it the mrt out here
and um it is fairly easy
okay can you see number three on your right hand side
okay
yes
just on the tram yah
normally it's a tinge of sweetness
so it's tea uh mixed with a lot of different kind of uh fruits but it is not um- it doesn't- it's not as thick as a smoothie
me~ you may be able to find them as well
alright lots of them
uh so orchard road it's one straight road
okay i'm giving you the map now
shopping
right
so these are the major brands can be found here
yah
yes we have a very good uh national museum at the bras basah area
the national museum will be closer to the supreme court
uh we wouldn't- you can also sit-in one of the court sessions in the supreme court if you are just uh yourself and your husband
so any of the courts that's open for hearing you can actually walk in um even for a ten minutes if you just want to sit-in and you can just give-
yes
right
yah
approximately about uh sixty- i would say i think in a region of about sixty to seventy storey
okay just uh- i think you should be able to see a portion of the road climbing up to bukit timah
yah you can consider staying around orchard road
uh starting from uh- just beginning of orchard road uh at the junction of scotts road we have like hyatt hotel marriott hotel
yes that's fine
uh the the- and this building just now you mentioned about post office right
yah
okay
uh yah that's right
okay
so you can do your morning uh swim in the beach the lagoon
okay so you c~ it's an island
uh okay sentosa can you see a uh a bridge
okay i will show you what the luge is like
that's the skyride
yah
okay you have a good day then
hello
this is uh tour guide one
okay i'm fine catherine
okay so how may i help you
alright
okay
they are found both in the transit area as well as just immediately after the- uh after you collect your bags and you exit from the airport
just get some smalls notes like a dollar coin two dollars notes and five dollars to enable you to travel on our mrt
right
once you go to the ticket machine uh you press your destination which particular station you want to go to and the machine will tell you how much to pay to that destination
so you will have to change train at the station the second station called tanah merah
yes
okay that's uh v hotel
uh they are i would say um reasonable rates and yet you are very uh right in the heart of the city
it's near to the somerset mrt
so let say you are staying somewhere on orchard road alright
oh you go to this and you just walk about five minutes
the esplanade and you will see this uh lion which is an icon of singapore
the merlion can you see on the top-right hand corner
okay
okay
you know you pick it up there then you board the mrt
yah
because the price it's very reasonable
amoy street food centre
but uh uh normally if you are non-muslims we don't encourage you to go in
so if you are not so uh- if you just want something a little bit light then you could try our fish soup with noodles
yah that you may not see in the normal uh kind of bakery
yah that you may not see in the normal uh kind of bakery
okay so that like you can do like a half day uh almost full day already right
uh as you can see there are different timings and uh different uh places of uh pick-up
ah okay
uh if he- if your nephew like the different- uh the animals you can do combine both together
uh you can also do- uh there's also a tram ride that you can take and then uh in the middle of the zoo you can alight and walk around do a little bit of the uh attractions
uh they are thro~ they are put in uh as close as possible to what they would live in the wild
yah
if he's into birds
so- yah we have like again different walks
you see uh the enclose right
uh okay uh yah unless you are guest
so uh they really sell all kinds of stuff in this flea market
okay and we want to go to little india right
just that uh traditionally this was a uh an indian quarters
the white ones
alright
and bangles okay
and you wrap it around your waist and you wear with a short blouse
lots of picture for you uh to see uh okay and the souvenir that i'm talking about these are jewellery uh boxes that i highlighted to you here
so you could do again the like three hours you know
okay
welcome
hi good morning
okay sure
and what are your interests
so do they like uh adventure or do they like uh nature
and uh is there any food that the children like to eat
okay and how about uh- what is the budget that you are looking uh to spend here
uh no that's-
alright
never mind
very small okay
okay i'm trying to enlarge again
and if you look down on the uh top-bottom part of the screen that's towards the south
yah
dhoby ghaut is- all the names that is stated on the screen are mrt train station
alright
you can stay in the orchard road area
okay
nothing else
but- yah
alright
uh oh yes
so in the morning you were saying that you want to do some uh breakfast first
okay what were- uh do you want to eat in a hotel
uh in the early morning and late evening uh from eight o'clock onwards temperature goes down to about twenty six degrees centigrade
okay this is chicken rice
yes
so a ten dollars is more than sufficient
alright
yes because we uh the child ticket we need the uh student pass uh fro~ for only for singapore student
yah
yes
so there are uh lots of food option at universal studio
she can take like the uh most of the other rides except uh where there is a height restriction
okay and there are also shows uh where your daughter may enjoy the show
yah for your kids to enjoy
right
i think they may be a little bit too tired already
so you would take the sentosa express out to harbourfront
yes
so there is no admission charges
yes
yes
uh facing the river front there are many restaurants there
so you can choose something that uh you know the whole family will get to enjoy
yes
yah it taste good as well
okay
julie i'm jeanne
yes
it's a male or a female may i ask
shall i show you the uh mass rapid transit system
to go to- from the airport into town the fastest way and uh very efficient
okay uh
uh it's also the business area
just-
in a nice place of town
we also have good class hotels there also
if you're talking about a mall are you talking about modern shopping centre or we have also street side shopping
i will get you little india later if you want
you could walk to your bus by the river
i just thought that uh so have more money shopping
feedback you will have to google maybe and find out
it's a boutique hotel actually do you see the hotel description
even the malls they start up at about ten o'clock in the morning
uh for using the train for too long because we don't want people to hang out in the trains
that's all
you are thinking of what kind of food
and you should go there different times of the day because in the morning you will get some stores that only sell up to lunch
uh right at the bottom on the green line
okay
uh the people who work at harbourfront at the malls they often go across the road to where the bus terminal is to get their food
yes there are
and uh buy or- buy a uh sort of a package
because images of singapore gives you uh the-
i think you need uh five days
yah
uh it's a different area altogether
it may not coincide with the time you are coming but let me see
okay
it's nice to just go there and take photos
um the shops would be not like your chinatown type
very nice place to hang out
oh dear don't tell me they only gave it for this month
you- oh you can have a look at- just to get an idea of what is on right now
so we just had the school holidays over
uh april i think they've all gone back to school
uh i'm afraid the background is black so-
let me see huh
yes it's a twelve to- oh no twelve to-
there's dance workshop on the seventeenth
you want me to open this up for you
there you go
you could but frankly uh you would have to take a trip to the island
i got to snorkel in very shallow water
uh and i have friends who go uh surveying
they're actually doing it for nature
hm what are you thinking of buying actually
laptop i suggest you go to this place called funan centre
let me get into the website
or you could um get on the street that is uh facing the direction out of your hotel the main street
that uh- like i said you can't- you can book the cab from your hotel or you can get reception to call you a cab
oh
uh you also- some tourist carry a little- do you smoke
uh shall i go to some other sites for you
the bar hopping i remember
yes
the outside area would not be hot- uh would not be cold
no you can buy
i hope you'll come and uh stay a few more days
this is tour guide one any my name is lynnette
that is for one person or two person
okay sure
so do you want me to show you the gardens first
or what do you want
okay the gardens first
okay
okay
uh yes
you're actually right there- at the eco uh garden
per person
okay and these are the rides that's available
no the- most of the rides are included unless they say that for example like the uh amber rock climb
that's uh additional charges for the children
this one is for the children
so you can go to this very famous bar
it's called zouk
okay
but it is uh one of almost uh world famous club uh in singapore
so this is uh- you have top of the world feeling
yes
okay
or to uh mail back the uh refund to you via your uh credit card to credit back your gst uh to your credit card
so it's very easy
at both ends of uh at one end of the airport area you will find a gst counter
and bring it to the officer that's located there
now another shopping centre you may want to consider would be a nice shopping centre called ion
yes
alright
and do you want me to recommend another shopping centre for you
then you go to next door called wisma atria
uh okay
so basically we fry this uh dish
and of course our very famous uh chicken rice
okay
and it is popular with the local who goes for the morning or evening walk up the hill
okay
okay so- and- you will have to take a bus called uh bus one seven zero from orchard road
and uh this is a ethnic area in singapore
and the vendor the food centre will cook for you
it' just a tinge of uh spice in there
are you also uh do you want to eat other things-
okay
so it's actually taste quite good on its own
you can dip them with curry
chicken saag curry mutton curry
okay
would you- do you like to do spa
okay
but they use the fish
okay
so the cost do you want to know the cost
alright if it's uh forty minutes that would cost you thirty eight dollars per session
this is the fish reflexology over at the uh underwater world
alright
uh if you want to take photography uh you would have to take it without flash
um okay
it should cost you about seventy uh two dollars
there is another called the fishing cat trail
okay
okay
hi my-
j e s
close to my name
are you planning to come to singapore sometime
uh this year or next year huh
yes and it's easily accessible
um i-
uh i'm gonna give you the name of a hotel uh which is practically next door
wait
oh yes
uh can i just ask what is your age range
okay let me try this other one
there are cheaper hotels than that perhaps
okay there's another hotel
uh lai chun yuen
the first word
uh like i said about ten minutes or-
so-
yah it says seven point five you see
what else uh are you interested in
let me see
the museum itself if you're very interested about- uh maximum one hour i think
if you like crowded shopping you should come during the fair time
okay just a minute huh
i think we have now about four times a year
yes comex
gadgets hm
yes that's right
uh yes there are shops- there are lots of shops there you know to buy clothings uh fashion other items
yah if you want buy- uh let me go to- if you want to buy cameras- are you interested in cameras
uh i'm trying to get the shopping centre for you here
it's- no it's a shopping centre
uh i believe there's a stall at the airport also run by a filipino
wait huh
new life
yah
yes
uh huh let me see
number ten east west number thirty two
yes to be safe
uh it's a night zoo
from your hotel you could go by train and then i'll get to the train section a little bit later
okay
including walking up and down the steps and everything maybe twenty minutes
the rates are quite decent
but there are also places that you can just do a walk
uh this one you have to travel because it's in the north and you are in the south of singapore
wet~ wetland reserve
but if you just want to see then you can continue on the bus and visit the rest of the places
of um-
uh you can chew it but you can't import it because if you stick the gum in the wrong place you can stop the trains from moving
that's why we have the rule because uh if there's no total contact the doors don't shut properly the trains get stuck
that's uh- this one
it's- thian hock keng
there it is
yes if you want to use your camera you get better light also
bye bye
yah
and uh places
so which one should i introduce you first
okay
i would like to introduce you to the chinatown uh of singapore
okay i'm just going to show you this is just one picture of chinatown
uh they all live near the singapore river
their houses you could see are more elaborate
so when they come here uh not every one of them would speak mandarin
so they will still be just speaking in their uh dialects
yah in the past they don't have uh motor vehicles
for people they would be using the trishaws
uh do you want me to introduce you to uh a museum in chinatown
yes
yes
so he came here because he was uh working for the british east india company
so singapore is now multi-racial
okay
so i'm going to show you again the image of the buddha relic temple
uh dress code you will have to be appropriately dressed
cute like i mean sorry uh cargo pants uh just will be fine
and of course during the buddha
uh if you are thinking of taking the mrt it is just about three lanes away
uh walk through some of the lanes probably would take you about uh one and a half hours
so well you can spend easily half a day just doing uh these few places
okay
uh do you know this food called chinese dim sum
yah
have you heard of this name before
yes so these are- lots of beautiful people over there to see and to be seen and party
okay so this is one of the clubs that you may want to visit
now you will have to uh take a mrt
and the closest mrt stop for you would be at this station called the uh tiong bahru mrt train station
yes
okay it will be party wear
yah
uh what sort of gadgets are you talking about
so we have uh let's say the three to the four star hotels uh ranges from about hundred and fifty uh onwards to about two hundred
okay
okay
um okay
uh no it's actually right in the heart of chinatown
yah
so quite a lot of hotels are located along orchard road
but of course if you choose to live further away there are also hotels available
okay
we only have a few of this glum tree that's left
this one would be uh in the so-called malay and the arab quarters
uh you are in the malay quarters so this is kampong glam and uh kampong glam as you can see from the left-hand side of-
uh and they serve uh rice with dishes
usually they are spicy
so that is another very typical uh malay food in uh where you can uh find in uh singapore
there are uh mid-eastern uh cuisine that you can find in uh kampong glam
egyptian-
uh but in kampong glam mainly it will be malay cuisine and indonesian i would say
uh the mosque will be crowded in the afternoon uh on friday
so that is uh the other- second culture that we're talking about uh in singapore
so traditionally uh these ethnic areas are where people used to live in the past
okay
i'm gonna show you some of the images here
uh the year that they were built is it
would you be interested to get on one
uh little india area um as well as around the padang area that's about it for the trishaw ride
uh the station uh is um located near bugis uh and you can see the trishaw there
yes so uh i have introduced you- to you three of our main cultures uh that we have here
yah we do have one more culture
okay
non-muslim ladies
uh october what do you mean
so you will always see the current exhibitions and that's always on-going
uh yes we have uh the kebaya collection
okay because they were originally chinese men and they inter-married with local non-malay- uh non-muslim ladies
yah
okay scenery
like buildings
i'm going to recommend- firstly you want to have a backpack type of hotel right
but uh you are looking for a room right
and uh can you see the rates on your screen
so it should be fifty nine for the two room
so you're actually paying about ten dollars more per person only
yes
little india has got two tran stations- two stops
and your hotel would be in that vicinity
that means one of you sleeps in a bigger bed
no it's between the airport but it's easier to just take the shuttle
and- to give you an idea
yah
it's one of my favourite places
so there are hindu temples there
you can photograph beautiful architecture and statues of the different deities the hindu deities
not vietnamese but there is uh kampong glam which you have to go by bus because- well actually you could go by train because you are young and healthy you can walk
uh go-
so let's say you are at little india you gotta run to dhoby ghaut
and then you take the red line which is called the circle line and you get just one stop at city hall station
so not only do you walk towards the malay quarter or rather the historic uh quarter for the malays the malays have mainly moved out from there
no curfew
um most singaporean's will not know what you mean when you say curfew
yah no problem
so if you take your train like little india you would take the train to dhoby ghaut you take the circle line down and you go down to marina bay
yes
yah
so you know they are migratory birds
uh you see the kranji express here
that's when the bus arrives to pick-up people
and we also have a show uh two shows in fact
and then the bird park you go uh on the day you go sungei buloh because you can take the train connection from kranji you would just go southwards and you are at jurong and you just take a bus and you are there
uh south indian food
these's one i am recommending to you
it's at old market
you just walk there
hm yes please
hi as well
alright
what about you
uh is it above thirty or um
uh when are you thinking of coming
instant ticket
alright
start uh-
so it would be one twin room
and near to the island there are other business class hotels like a hundred over dollars
but if you want to save the money on- to spend time on sho~ uh spend the money on shopping and other things then we have the three-star hotels
yes
so that's why i-
uh now if you want to bring a cardigan just for the air-conditioned areas
lots of places for shopping but uh do you see the screen resorts world singapore
so- so you- your-you see the price there
so you know this is a very high price uh hotel at five hundred
actually- singa
uh different uh races here
we were uh- but archaeological diggings have found that chinese have been coming here
he allowed people of different races to settle here to trade here
and he didn't charge taxes and that's why we became very popular with the people settling here and still today
if you're interested in the island- m hotel is
can you see it on your screen
yah
yes mass rapid transit
yes mass rapid transit
yes that's right
just a minute
the bed
alright here we go
a hundred and twenty
so i'm assuming you want a room because if you go dormitory you see what i mean
and- okay
so uh if you're into heritage this is really the place to be in
oh we have this uh reverse bungee jump
where you zip from one end to the other end right
oh we have on sentosa right at the bottom but let me get to this one first
yah so you really have to be an adventurist to do it
zip-line is better i think
it's safer
uh it's a bit scary for people like me
you'll get into a um oh dear what is it called
i think uh it could be- let me see
i'm a relaxed traveller i
yah
uh then you can go to other attractions you see
yes
in little india-in between little india and farrer park there are small uh hotels there
and then you can move by train to chinatown and visit chinatown on foot
yes
so in little india you try the indian food
yah
or chinese noodles in chinatown you know like- three four dollars
this is a card we carry and i suggest you get it when you come
and then when you buy the card you um get benefits at certain places
yes that's right
so you put in money
so if you think you're gonna travel a lot you can put in more money
that's right yes
that's okay alright
and i look seeing you mirelle
alright
thank you
hi good afternoon
okay
but that would be mid-august for you
uh and also uh very calm because the waters there are pretty calm
because you can actually swim inside the lagoon
alright i'm gonna just show you sentosa and i'm just going to show you some of the beaches we have
yes
uh i think we are very different
our beaches are i would say man-made alright
so as long as you're just swimming inside the buoys you are actually i would say very safe
yes it's an island of the southern part of singapore
we normally would not uh do snorkelling uh on sentosa island
uh like i said no unfortunately
but uh we do more of uh scuba diving of the off-shores islands of singapore
and i think if your son is uh very much into a little bit more adventurous and a little bit more exciting or in fact your whole family yourself and your wife included you could go and do this mega-zip adventure park
okay you are going downslope so it's really exciting uh if you get on to this luge and you can do a one-way luge and the other way by uh skyline is the open-air cable car
uh the whole island is resort
uh you can even climb up or take a ride into the merlion
uh it's a beachfront hotel
okay so this is uh rasa sentosa hotel
um even the locals like to shop and eat alright
okay in here there are all very interactive
and north-south line will be in red colour
alright
two dollars and twenty cents singapore dollars
so because i don't think you're going to travel that much so i think it is cheaper if you just buy uh per trip basis
uh no that's an additional of ten dollars
yes
yes
and for dinner options uh because uh you'll be spending uh quite a fair amount on your hotel stay
uh yes we do have a food court uh located on sentosa island
yes so you can have like uh fried hokkien noodles uh a fried carrot cake alright satay
yes
so it's the savoury and we can eat it for breakfast lunch or dinner
or if you really want something very exotic uh we do take uh the turtle soup in singapore
because if you are going to stay in a uh i would say uh um uh above- let say about three to four hundred dollars stay in the res~ uh in the hotel then you could actually um of course take a chance to uh taste all our local food our street food in full
okay so uh besides-
the non-air-condition uh food centre would be the prices would be a little bit cheaper
yes we hope to see you soon then
okay welcome
okay welcome
yah huh
uh two days would be one night
ok~ oh yes
and uh what you want is attached bathroom and you want a fridge
uh there are shops nearby
you actually very near to chinatown across the river
yes with that lady there right
okay
you take the train which is the fastest
any traffic jams uh it's not affected by it
number three
that is all
if you go to the next stop clarke quay that's very near to your hotel
and if you yes
they don't show the
and more than the fifteen dollar set meal that you get down by the river where you are
indian restaurants
and these are the major restaurants there
south indian food cuisine is quite hot
it's also on the train
uh if you could- yah i guess you could call it a flea market
they've inherit- they've inter-married with the local malays and they have- the people have- the malays have merely moved out to the eastern side
it's true
and when you're at little india if you go a little bit earlier for your dinner you go across the road to little india arcade and you can get lots of souvenirs there too
uh let me see
okay
yes
by the river just outside your hotel
have you heard of the merlion
it's a- it is a symbol for the singapore tourism board originally uh because a prince that came to singapore thought he saw an animal and he was wondering what it was
i can't confirm that
but i don't think you can a rent house for one day
uh it's very original
okay
okay
okay
airfare i think there are various airlines um you might want to- can you travel on cebu air
manila and your destination is singapore
okay
oh from the airport you can easily take the mass rapid transit that we call the mrt
your two thousand dollars if you're just staying a few days you could get a car to pick you up from the airport
your two thousand dollars if you're just staying a few days you could get a car to pick you up from the airport
yah conversion
yes you can get hotels about a hundred over dollars
um if you save on the accommodation then you have more money to visit attractions
where we have um the merlion which is the symbol of singapore
uh sorry you want to use your phone while you are touring you can
you know what i mean
there is a package ticket
and because you are you know short of time-
uh huh
i can guess you said morning you're going to the bird park
yes
uh yes
because to do the three in one you are a little bit limited in time
yes
yah
okay
and this beach actually has a filipino name it's siloso beach
and one dollar if you take the public bus in which i suspect you will need to after on your visit to all the parks you'll be a bit tired
free yes it's free
it's cool and breezy
uh maybe if the sun is out it's a bit warm
uh okay
okay
yes correct
for a resort hotel i think it's very affordable
in china there are some records
um are you thinking of chinese or- indian
there's a thick uh good quality black sauce chinese black sauce
there's one in the east coast
from india and- let me see
the shipwreck that was found off indonesia has got a lot of items there that shows that there's trade in this region uh that passed through singapore
and the permanent exhibits we also have artefacts from india
that's the permanent
oh we sometimes walk along the bay you know by the singapore river
it's- you can see the bay you can see um the marina bay sands hotel which has become very iconic
just down here and that's the river here
and they also have convention facilities
uh huh
uh okay
for- yah that's for three- all three attractions the zoo the bird park and the night safari
even if you're a foreigner you get the discount
yes euke
but i keep thinking i'm speaking to a japanese
okay
is this your first trip to singapore
what is the price for this hotel is it
yah because it's just walking to most of the uh places
uh yes it's called one fullerton
the zoo
okay
you will be alighting and walking just above five minutes to the uh marina bay
from- or just uh one stop away from your hotel
uh walking kilometres approximately about uh five kilometres
and there is a very interesting museum on marina bay as well it's called the arts and science museum
the arts and science museum
alright the zoo will be located in the northwest of singapore
yes you will take the mrt from city hall
yes
uh six pm
uh the price range will range from a dollar forty cents uh right up to two dollars and twenty cents
provincial as in the residential area
it is also a very accessible location because there is the mrt uh that is located um just about less than ten minutes' walk to the mrt
okay uh the rates uh of course again it depending sometimes they do have promotions uh in uh certain uh during certain dates
uh yes per day
okay let's see whether there's any promotion in april
birds
just at the corner of the link hotel you have this like uh a birds corner
and for food wise uh just above the market there is uh open-air- not open-air it's a non-air-condition food court
yes if you are coming in december again it's something different
okay i'm showing you elizabeth hotel now
so it's also uh interesting place uh to stay and you can see this is the last year the christmas light-up in orchard road
you are somewhere between- rendezvous is somewhere between orchard and the marina square area
yearly basis
specially for your kids we have wildwest uh wet and wild uh in the eastern part of singapore
yes it is um on the east- northeast of singapore
yes it is um on the east- northeast of singapore
yah
yes it's a park uh nice to stroll around in the evening uh morning
yes
alright thanks for calling
and your child is below twelve
okay
yes uh-
cheapest
uh uh meaning the dress code or behaviour
just now you were asking me about your hotel
alright
there's one at chinatown the inn at temple street
uh and that's another one at victoria street about a hundred and thirty dollars
okay so for your son i would like to recommend- does he like animals
and the machine will tell you how much money uh the fare will be
uh it was celebrated on the twenty third and twenty fourth
we call it the bukit timah nature reserve
uh well of course uh dress comfortably good walking shoes
alright
and for your child it will be eight dollars singapore money
it's just a cruise on the singapore river
so on- this is what you are going to see uh on the cruise
and uh of course they- when you come out of the bay you will see the merlion uh icon
more for your son
i would uh recommend to you uh to bring him to the science centre in singapore
minimum one to three hours alright would be sufficient
uh normally for immigration we give a one month uh visitor pass
so you see the leopards here the malayan tapir the fishing cat
half an hour to forty minutes and you go back to the tram station and board back the next tram
alright fishing cat trail about twenty minutes
this is a show it's a- just a twenty minute show- thirty minute show
alright
and this is located in um sentosa island
okay the underworld is located on sentosa island
you see this uh yellow colour looking marine life
uh also for uh certain rides in the universal studio there's a height limit
are you in your twenties
thirties or-
uh mar~ are there thirty one days in march
that means you only pay about twenty to uh maybe thirty forty dollars a room night
with a toilet attached huh
uh you have a chaperone huh
there is a place i know
and uh hortpark in fact allows you to use the rooms for a formal wedding proposal
you just uh go there
you can take a lot of photos on your way in
i'm just trying to find you a room that can put in an extra bed for your girlfriend's brother
uh the-
and use the trains and the buses to move around because many of our buses like ninety nine point nine nine are- per cent are air-conditioned
okay
so there you approach the officer and buy a ez-link ticket
you get off at city hall and you switch to the red line to dhoby ghaut
so at dhoby ghaut you will just take two stops down to chinatown
and you are not staying too many days so you just carry a backpack or you know small luggage you can-
they ha~ this is a dialect cuisine called teochew
but it is soaked in vinegar
uh there is also something called jelly pork
uh they have also something like deep fried pork and liver roll
all over
universal studios yes
okay
so you can just you know walk through and have a look
yes you are
it's all still on the budget
uh not only within universal studios but on the island as well
and i suggest you skip the casino
you go down to the green line and then you switch east bound to city hall
uh although they are now- right now being uh renovated to be turned into the singapore uh art museum- oh sorry the singapore- a big museum for singaporeans to enjoy
uh you go there- uh try and go there in the morning where many people are marketing
uh but in the- uh little india has lots of sweets also milk-based sweets in the same area
but uh if you prefer to go there faster you take a train uh to tanah merah
i think there will be more people around and uh-
uh inside if you want to see the history of singapore only uh there is a foyer on the upstairs level you can take the lift or walk up the stairs
uh what sort of a christian are you
and the catholic and anglican churches have lots of statues inside you know of their saints
the priest will allow it
and when you get off i believe there's even a sign to tell you where this building is
so there's a great atmosphere there
uh in fact some of them they just put up a sign to say uh so many dollars for a jug of beer
uh ten of fifteen dollars because they want to show that they are not expensive
uh so you know because people like you have the same idea that it looks expensive
okay
and you find lots of people there
clarke quay is a bit more upscale than a food court
uh normal price is about uh ninety eight dollars for one hour
uh full body massage but sometimes they will offer it first time trial for thirty eight dollars
uh full body massage but sometimes they will offer it first time trial for thirty eight dollars
uh you can just walk by yourself to visit the hindu temples in little india
in chinatown we have a fairly new temple called the buddha tooth relic temple
and it's within walking distance from where you are
are you talking about shopping malls
it's spelt v i v o city
so you buy your souvenirs and you end up at a uh temple and the museum
but you really should walk there because that's the nearest place
and you can see uh the oldest or well- one of the oldest temples in singapore
and if it's on the fine day you can even get to see uh indonesian riau islands
a photo of the capsule
yah
we have seven zones that you can see
uh interesting ride
alright
but they are-
okay
they are all below a hundred dollars
yah
uh the closest one of course would be the chinatown mrt
and you can also board the train on sentosa itself we call it the sentosa express
okay for your uh and you are uh holding a philippine passport
and sentosa island is our one of our island
the park will be open from uh seven thirty in the night time to twelve midnight
but please keep all your- any parts of your body to yourself
um the other highlight would be the leopards that you can see up close uh to you
yah by a glass enclosure okay
yes
yes
okay
just the smaller animals uh for you to see uh a little bit closer alright
yes and it uh-
but i don't uh- you don't really need to stay until twelve pm
but as usual anywhere else in the world you just avoid all the dark lanes um and do not uh carry too much cash with you that's all
alright
it's called borderx
yes it's rock climbing
okay i am showing you the location it's right in the heart of the orchard road
you see they are climbing up this wall
but all of us use a different recipe
yah
yes okay now yah
okay so this is one i think you don't get them back home
okay yah
yes
so everywhere you travel give yourself one hour is more than sufficient
there are quite a few clubs there as well
okay now uh there are entrance fee so again it depends on which particular club you want to go to
uh then of course there more expensive club uh world famous like uh ku dÉ ta uh that's over at marina
for alcohol uh we have a very good selection of wines uh from all over the world
so it's going to be too wide uh to let you know like which uh cocktail to recommend to you
okay sure
yes
you could get uh a bed space uh for as cheap as less than fifty dollars singapore dollars
uh twenty five dollars alright
uh the beach
and uh then otherwise if you want uh the nicer beach that would be at the uh sentosa or to take a boat to the southern islands
next one extreme uh swing and this is something quite new is ifly
okay so that's the wakeboarding that you are talking about
yah so you can- oh that one
okay so these are things that you may want to consider to do uh when you are in singapore
alright
ah okay
they would be speaking in their local dialect
so we can see how- uh what kind of living conditions they were living in um in the uh chinatown heritage centre
okay
uh and something that's very interesting would be a round kind of cake called the mooncake
but now uh with the modern um uh influences you can even have uh all sorts of filling from uh durian uh to egg custard chocolate blueberry mooncake alright
at the uh chinatown some of the pictures and what you can do over in chinatown
as you can see from the houses here they are a little bit different from the chinatown houses
and this- no it's uh just a few street uh and you can walk
and since you're there don't forget to try some malay food
uh for example some of the malay food would be uh mee siam mee rebus nasi padang that means nasi is rice rice with different dishes
uh yes generally the malay cuisine uses a lot more spices compared to the oth~
yes shirts and other interesting cafés out there as well
okay this is haji lane out here
okay this is haji lane out here
okay universal studio is a theme park
now you can see this uh rollercoaster
yes
okay because uh you get a very good sc~ uh view you can see the landmarks behind
okay so this is the kite flying uh over at the marina barrage
there you can see lots of people flying kites out there
now you see these three towers here
you can go into the casino
okay if you want to have a good view of the southern part of singapore as well as the south china sea you can a take ride up to the cantilever
yah well there's a lot of things you wanna do that you can do yah in singapore
uh like i mention everywhere you go in singapore will probably take you only uh half an hour to one hour if you are taking the public transport
uh it's called bukit chandu
yes there are few museums you can check
yes there are few museums you can check
uh this one will be the wax uh figure showing you the surrender of singa~ uh of the japanese to the allied forces in nineteen forty five
yah
if you just want to see the last battle or do you want to see like more of the uh artefacts that were used uh- alright there's one here
okay yes
then you will be on the eastern side of singapore
okay it has very good review and it's right in the heart of the heritage area of kampong glam
betel box uh betel it is name after the betel nut
so yah
and the actua~ uh the street name will be called the riverwalk
okay so if you are talking about hip-hop then it will be butter factory
just grab a few friends and you're done
uh that would cost you fifteen dollars along the uh okay along the singapore river
okay just give me a minute
uh yes the price is the same but of course we are looking at uh different scenery
if you still have the time uh and energy then you just go for a river cruise on the singapore river
yah uh it's used to ferry goods in the past uh this kind of boat
alright
i don't know whether you see this boat out there
yes
hello
oh arlyn i see
uh can i have your dates again please
uh but at four years old uh- some of the rides she may not be able to take
you can do both if you have time
she can also uh see- you know pet the little animals the small ones that are like rabbits and uh pygmy horses you know
normally you have a month to use up the ticket but- so if you're staying just two or three days you would definitely use it up
it's actually token feeding
and some like these tapirs they are tame enough for them to roam around along the trails
i show you the zoo first and then i give you the package ticket okay
and we have-
and we have the sea lions that do a show you can get your daughter to take part in the show
you're talking about normal cultural shows uh nothing to do with the zoo right
uh what i'm showing you is actually a show that just shown uh in a resort
but when you're here if there are shows at our esplanade which i will show you later you might want to book them
uh if you go to sentosa island you go to the beach this is just uh along the beach
uh i think premium seats are more in the centre and let me scroll down i think these are premium seats
but i think here you'll get a better view
i don't know if this they tell it here but i saw it months ago it's ninety minutes
it's a circus uh theatre production and- oh i didn't even know it's created in singapore through a celebration of song and dance
it's full of activity so one and a half of hours
yes every day uh i think
uh because it's so popular they want to have a earlier show so some people take the show and then they uh do the songs of the sea after that
uh i think hundred and eight is good enough already
uh so this is marina bay sands it's the other resort in singapore and it's down by the bay
it's not very far from sentosa in fact
okay we have here- uh let me go to the shopping alright
oh you have to search for the store let me see
tangs is the short form t a n g and it's at vivocity just in front of sentosa island
uh anything else you want to see by way of shops
and so it's a protected building and it's been converted into hotel rooms
it's in the heart of chinatown
yes
yes
the zoo price was about sixty dollars right
so you have spent uh four hundred- almost five hundred dollars
uh maybe you shall pay uh twenty dollars or twenty five dollars for the ticket uh it's called the ez-link card for- you know when you travel by train and by bus
and the good thing is you can see food that is being sold
soya bean a dollar as a dessert five dollars for her
uh so that too
so because it's so cheap you can take a variety and the three of you can share
usually- i think yes there is a thai there is what she call herself japanese but you know it's the cheaper type of japanese food there
uh you can get things for one or two dollars um-
when i first did chinatown we had a street side fortune tellers but they are gone now
yah
can you see the picture of the stalls there
and then it's quite crowded
oh you do okay
i have some myself
oh you don't know how to use chopsticks
up market you can go to marina bay sands and uh for lesser price items lower price items you can do your shopping in chinatown
my name is jeanne
and i'm tour guide number two
how are you eric
uh who are you traveling with
okay
i think if you- hm if you come in early in the morning you might be able to uh do maybe just walk around your hotel i think
the bay grandstand you get a view of the uh bay that has been turned into a reservoir
we close our streets and we have lots of concerts
okay
if they are overtaking uh doing something rather dangerous you can see because some of the bends there are- it's a bit dangerous for them
i'm not sure but the tax let me see huh the ticket prices let me go back to it
i think it includes
then you would book a bed in a hostel
you want a cheap safe accommodation is it
oh so you want to have your own bathroom
so air conditioning is like a must in hotels
uh okay
in some hotels you would be able to get two nights
let us try less than a hundred
it's a hundred and fifty eight
uh the first two that states little india you are very near to town and you can get to your race very easily by the trains
you can take a train
it's- if you would travel far then you waste time traveling
but in this area at broadway hotel it doesn't really matter because all around you are cafes and uh also restaurants
so single without breakfast right up to december is a hundred and forty dollars
so i think they don't provide breakfast here
so they have laptops they have the peripherals
but you can go to a place called bugis where we have a little lane and there are lots of little stalls selling very low priced um souvenirs
and what we've done is we've conserved the old buildings
do you know pandan leaves that are fragrance
but if you don't like that's optional
uh yes
something that's very nice uh that uh we like and tourist like and the restaurants are- the food vendors are very good at
if you want to save money for shopping then you go for the side street vendors
uh normally this meal you share it with friends because it's finger licking good
but then uh there are parts of it you can't reach so they give you a little fork to dig in
so you dip this bun into the gravy
when i was young we uh just add it with plain white bread
it goes by the crab
it goes by the crab
uh maybe thirty- i'm estimating on the highest side in case the price of the crab goes up at the time
so it's alright if you go and ask how much they weight and you can walk away and say "no i don't want to take" you know
if i too expensive i tell them " no uh yah
maybe twelve fifteen
no i don't think they raise their prices
that is the river which is right next to the f one uh race track
and you know uh it would be maybe a little bit more adventurous
so they would be happy to accommodate you
uh you will still have money left over
chicken rice and chili crab are very singaporean because we uh supposed to have adopted the chicken rice from china but we have revolutionalised it so it's totally our own brand
yes
uh you've got to come before the new year because during the chinese new year some of the restaurants maybe closed for the first day or the second day to give their staff a break
uh we have- wait
so it's just next door to city hall
so you know uh it's not there for you to photograph
and the actual court is just behind it
uh if you are booking your tickets you'll be sitting right here opposite connaught drive
can you see boat quay
it's along there
otherwise if you are looking at things which i presume you will be doing maybe ten minutes
yes that's right
it's a room where you find out about uh the islamic culture and they have got old calligraphy uh small little e~ korans you know the holly book for the muslims with hand drawn calligraphy
so you get a good view
and you may even get it free that's talk about allowing you free entry to the museums
i think souvenirs you get from chinatown and little india you would save money
unless you don't mind walking a little bit more
can you see on the right side of your map
and when you go down westwards you travel down
uh city hall is maybe a little bit nearer- two minutes nearer to where you would be seated for your show
it's a mix
when you come down from the airport you get a good view until kallang yes
so the traffic- if there is a build-up of traffic then there would be a delay
uh past midnight
you can also- can you see on your screen
thank you
hello good morning or good afternoon
this is jeanne
you want to have a room or are you willing to go backpacker style
you want to have a room or are you willing to go backpacker style
for wha~ okay
so you want backpacker but you want to have a room
well- uh tours you can do yourself
in chinatown
and we also have in little india asphodel inn
where you can choose from a whole variety of indian food
it's very good
in my grandfather's time it was
but- most of the shopkeepers and the people who sell things along the roadside they understand basic english
uh so if you can't understand them just ask them to repeat what they are saying
uh yes uh but if i went to chinatown
'cause-
yes
who composed songs and music with using singlish
okay
so here you're seeing a free-flight aviary within the jurong bird park which is part of the wildlife reserves
uh very good for photography
if there is none printed out you just ask the girl at ticketing
so you visit the zoo in the afternoon and the night safari in the evening
so here we have the uh- there is a tram ride and there's also uh walking trail
uh wait
they are really beautiful
uh beca- the daytime is what we called the singapore zoo
can you see here thirty-two dollars admission and tram
can you see at the bottom night safari and zoo
you'll pay fifty-eight dollars
uh except if you are buying you know bird park and night safari of course you won't be at the zoo twice
it's a long street but it's very walkable
it's a long street but it's very walkable
and also little india
and you can also go into the shops to buy
they are very competitive
uh for us it's not like this
you know like the package for visiting the zoo the bird park and night safari to encourage you to buy more
but let's have some of the shops first
uh you will be able to see them as you walked around
we have uh universal studios there
you can also eat there
there are- there's uh inexpensive like a food court where you have a variety of food
so you have a better idea of where you are
so you have a better idea of where you are
and this stop is very near to your hotel
yes on the island the same bus
so what you pay is just two dollars to enter the island
uh hm that- oh when you reached the bus train in sentosa
just hold on minute
uh there are-
it is along-
no not in sentosa it's on the east coast of singapore
but uh yah it's a little bit rare
if you are on a boat ride out
just for a second
that would be on this island called sentosa where you go to the beach
so uh th-
except see them behind glass
yah and the- and the package includes a t-shirt souvenir and your boyfriend can take your photograph for you
if you are generous and you want the fish to uh have a nibble at your feet

good afternoon
i am jeanne
guide number two
how do you spell your name
and your fiancé would be the same age as you right
yes
oh they speak- uh depends on who speak you to
do you know
and then when you're going to sentosa you'll take the direction that says harbourfront
at tanah merah you need to get off and switch to go to town
so this is where you go westwards
so you just stand on the correct side of the station
yes
uh let me get the ones in chinatown
the building dates from nineteen twenty-nine and it's in a quiet -er part of the chinatown
here
uh no i haven't
uh you can walk out 'til midnight you know
and can you see additional remarks and notes
okay
yes the deluxe is a double bed
they have- they have not mentioned any surcharge for easter weekend
so you can visit the catholic churches uh for mass
is it good friday
can you see this one
saint- saints peter and paul
uh you just cross a few streets
okay
i'm gonna try uh this other name
uh there you get a variety and you can see uh whether the food is suitable to you
i'm just interpreting it
i- they have a story about it but i don't remember exactly
so you don't have to be a university student to eat there
uh dinner time i suggest you go a bit earlier because some stalls may close in the evening
uh where the number a- can you see the a there
you can have al fresco dining
uh that means you are sitting outside the restaurant
uh some of them are sports bars that might interest you
okay so-
yes so it's just one bus ride from you know the bras basah road i showed you just now where the food courts are
normally the tickets are sold at the door
i'm trying to get the pictures for you
and this is king of the skies show
so there will be many people putting up their hands
so you see this uh creatures here
so you're fully protected
and the orang-utans at the back the ones in brown they have a sort of open area where they can swing around and play in the trees
and you can see the- you can see these creatures in black and white
because when you wait then you have a chance to see better
at night
have a meal before the actual entrance to the park opens at seven thirty
because that's when we get night time
it's re- yes
i forget what it is
le~ uh are you interested in the ticketing prices for this
they have something called the bongo burger which is the name of an animal
but it's just normal meat
i hope to see you in singapore dodie
hi good afternoon
yah
yes the hari raya puasa is a public holiday in singapore
alright with- it's a piece of cloth five point five metre without any zips or button uh and it's a matter of folding the cloth
uh but otherwise most of the other time i would think that because of the uh western- uh modern influences well the indian ladies today would also be wearing the normal kind of uh clothes that any other lady in the world would be wearing alright the modern kind of dressing
uh no it's for the ladies
the guys will be wearing um quite similar to what the uh malay guys are wearing
it will be uh like a blo~ uh a shirt with uh long pants
uh park
you can see all these beautiful ladies wearing the traditional sari alright
uh sorry
yah
yes the mother tongue for the indians uh in singapore generally uh tamil uh unless they come from the northern part of singapore then they would be speaking hindi
okay
well uh- yes
so again this is one food that they will uh be uh having that a lot of them also like to eat this food called uh tandoori
yes
yah
yes
yes
uh this will be the celebration for christmas
well you can walk
yah
uh it is like the main uh shopping belt in singapore
so uh they are also nicely decorated for christmas so of course with-
if you mean participate by coming down to orchard road do a little bit of shopping and uh soaking in the atmosphere uh and taking photograph then yes
yes
so and uh- yes we have a street party out here
alright
eight pm
okay you can choose this hotel
uh because you're- if you're going to just stay a short uh stay in singapore uh no problem alright
so you know you just walk down to the are- the street that is all lighted up okay to visit york hotel
we will check
uh like i said uh every month every other week we have uh act that is uh playing uh in singapore whether it's a recital from classical right up to uh rock singer celebrity musical
so well we will check what is coming in the month of uh december
yes
that is still in april
it's a mix
and you could always book uh tickets online uh for the acts that you want to see
and normally the concert comes on uh at eight o'clock in the night time
b a y yes
party in the ocean
so you are asking me where is the marina- uh the esplanade is just here where you- at the bottom right hand corner on the opposite side of these three tower this is marina bay sands resort
the theme uh the- these are changing uh temporary exhibition uh otherwise the main exhibition will be on art and science alright
uh more than a month
okay this is the very famous club
um and they always have like uh cutting edge design
okay
you like indie disco
okay
so i'm just giving you two options since you said that you don't want to get too far away from the marina bay sands area
so they have different i~
yah
the closest mrt is city hall so what- from marina bay you could actually take the mrt and uh stop at city hall
uh it is-
okay thank you
alright
so it's one of the romantic place yah
we have- if you are talking of uh on top then mount- uh bukit timah hill
okay this is still very romantic as well
so there are quite a fews uh spots
uh that would be about ten minutes' walk
labrador park
yah so you are uh going to do your proposal in the botanical gardens
alright
uh yah
but it's a quite uh old uh photograph already
okay i think this is quite a good choice uh hotel
and you're right smack uh you can see this is the map of orchard
and uh maybe you may want to do some uh body massage in singapore
they can uh provide this service
uh it's just about a ten minutes' ride
uh a lots of option um- yes
i mean sorry you will eat with your hands
rather than eating with your spoo~ uh fork and uh knife
s~
yah
okay
uh okay
and of course uh satay
um well i would think that dempsey would be uh just uh off orchard road
uh you will have to walk if you really want to walk
yah
uh the local would like to call this- it looks like um the porcupine
we called it the esplanade
uh november december possibly about thirty degrees in the mid-afternoon
morning evening right up to about nine am in the morning
it would be in the temperature range of about twenty-six degrees
and the kind of products they carry uh would be one of its kind
uh and uh this is an area where we allow some graffiti
well um singapore is not that big
alright
so it's not like- well i- i don't encourage you to walk from orchard road to kampong glam
it's a bit of like smoking
uh what
sport
yah so- no you are not- nowhere near waters at all
uh otherwise you can always stop for um a coffee uh or tea uh with some snacks
so you can do this uh sightseeing over in kampong glam area
so this is a bit of uh sightseeing cum a little bit of shopping for ethnic products
okay
uh indian temple out here
uh light up during the deepavali season in the month of november
so this is little india
you will see uh this building
just about ten minutes' walk
and um-
this is our- it's supreme court
i called it a spaceship
okay
it's nice
it's all within the vinicity of this rectangular uh greenfield
you can- if you want to visit
okay
um and there would be uh english commentary on the boat
um and right now uh these boats are run on electricity
either you uh break at the raffles place
so that you can do in the afternoon late morning
yes
uh where she can do her shopping
alright
so that's a lots of shopping uh options uh available
okay
so are you going to have it in them- in the restaurant or in the uh hawker centre at the non-air-conditioned food place
uh it is more than enough time for you to enjoy the park
uh because on the tram itself you actually get to see seventy per cent of the animals
uh yes
um yes i think uh based- like i said on what your uh- well your coming here of course the highlight most important one would be your proposal
this is lynnette here
hello
june
would you like to go to hotel in chinatown
when you come in you are at number three on the right-hand side of your screen
on the green line
and then you go out up one stop to chinatown
so all that is underground and also up to chinatown
so when you switch you just get off your train
if you take the purple line down south can you see number six on the map
beaches
later you tell me what are the other attractions that you like to visit what is the-
uh we have golf courses on sentosa island
so the mrt map the map for the trains don't show you the location of our rivers
uh but here where you see the blue on the map that is formerly just the entrance to the river
the merlion is- do you see a little i there
day and night
let me try and get you uh places where you can golf in singapore first
just a moment
i'm sorry
ninth of april up 'til
so good
uh and i think there's some membership if they joined uh for singaporeans where they get some discount
we had the timings earlier right
see it's seven o'clock
uh huh
so you're gonna play golf on tuesday right
so you okay with chinatown
do you want the picture of the whole hotel
you- you want a dining area for the hotel
i'm gonna go to full list
you might be able to get the um concierge to buy something for you from somewhere nearby and just pay him for it
you can- uh if you get them the walk of chinatown you'll be able to uh follow it and do a walk
so you can have breakfast in your kitchen marble table and two chairs
uh i don't think so because these are just three-story buildings
uh they are very cosy because they are in restored buildings that are protected
it doesn't- yah
uh yes it is
so from marina bay if you uh come out and go to the uh city centre area that's where we have the esplanade theatres on the bay
it's uh a big theatre and concert hall
and places where you can have a drink or a meal
it's called one fullerton and there are lots of uh places you could have a meal
so on the south banks of the river where you see north canal road
and some of them would actually eat uh along the singapore river
i forget the name um but it was a very good japanese restaurant if you like japanese food
oh if you do street shopping then it's a bit warm
uh it-
that means the early history of singapore and what went on by the uh- sorry
used for the decor it's called the marina barrage
so here you go
yah
so you have uh- four hun~ five-
i see
yes you are right
that's an original spelling
can you tell me your interest please for yourself and your friend
i think your uh shuttle cock might blow away into the water
they're all in the same location
and if you like you can also pay a small fee and you- if you don't mind getting wet go down and uh play with the dolphins
uh surfing i'll have to check that out
sentosa island isn't um- you know the beaches are very calm and uh yah
yes
okay sentosa is a huge amusement park
you don't see so many animals within cages uh yah
and now for feeding you cannot bring your own bird seeds
okay when you carry the cup and the birds fly in and take it off the cup
yes in this aviary they are fed live worms
yes in that place also
so when you watch the show you and your friend must remained seated
it's a uh a reproduction
yes an owl
uh they actually show you how um you can train a bird
so- yes because i haven't seen it myself
yes for- that's for children um of up to a certain uh heights
have you heard of durian
uh it's a different restaurant
yes a female who was very popular and she's been buried at the zoo
but it has been given her name in honour of her service uh to the zoo in popularising the zoo
so in this restaurant you can get all kinds of food and outside the restaurant there is also um indian food there is chinese food
uh they are in an enclosure so uh they cannot climb up the wall
i don't remember exactly the date but uh just a few months
uh so it re-creates the um famous rivers throughout the world and the forest
they will be coming soon to singapore
not right now if you came
so uh you take a ride along the river and when you're taking that ride the keeper the person who was with you the guide will show you specimens from the zoo
like um you know anima~ the snakes when they moult they leave behind the skin
uh no this is not ah ming
uh ah ming is so famous
we all know what she looks like
six about six yes
um and if you want to go to all three parks like the bird park zoo and night safari i suggest uh you go to the bird park in the morning and then you go to-
and the tapirs you can see because they are roaming around
uh there's actually glass between the leopards and them yes
uh pictures of nocturnal animals let me see
uh python is very heavy yes i couldn't carry it
yes and uh to control the crowd as you are walking in we have uh-
so uh it's in the area of africa that is like singapore equatorial you know
it's a big like a buffalo
i'm trying to find you the pricing
that's right
oh jurong bird park then you just pay the fee a little bit lower than uh forty two yes
you're not interested in the night safari or the zoo
it will bring you not only to the waterfall aviary but to another area where you see lorries you know parakeets from australia
so you just get on you get off and you show your ticket again and you can get on again
so if you don't want to take the ride it's only eighteen dollars
yes five dollars
uh sorry at the bird park
uh on the beach-
yah it depends on the time you go
the pictures are appearing now
you are near to attractions and you like i said you could visit the underwater world
that's a monday okay good
so april the children are in school in singapore so nobody checks in
shall we check out the- you have lots of money so you can stay two nights huh
yes it's daily rate so it would be two to nine
okay
uh so twenty three for your bird park uh twenty five for underwater world
three dollars to enter sentosa
yah well including the one dollar is three dollars
so allow thirty dollars per person
okay
uh sort of triangular shape
if you see bukit merah on the map can you see it
now the city and all these other lines did you see
uh short journeys that you do in town will just cost you uh a dollar twenty if you go little bit further out
so i'll show you the mrt map
no you don't have to
so you just tap it at the sensor when you are entering the stations
and tap it at uh when you come out the gate will open when you are on the subway
i did it once with a friend
so that is the only thing yah
okay ethnic area we have two uh that is uh very easily uh connectable for you you can from there to other places
uh in uh little india in fact we have uh buddhist temple and also a church there
in chinatown well you don't want a dormitory do you
so it actually depends on the individual hotel
so uh what sort of food do you enjoy
yes furama city centre
okay i thought you would like the money for shopping or some other thing huh
lai chun yuen is uh closer right into the heart of chinatown
it takes his name from the road
and you can have breakfast over there
so it's quite homely isn't it
yes all the hotels along this little streets are converted shop houses
but uh for the majority of the hotels they are made up of buildings where peopl used to live upstairs and they run a business downstairs
uh you know the flesh the coconut
yah
and yakun is one of the most places
and what we do is we take it with dark uh soy sauce
so you have the savoury eggs and then you have the sweet toast
yes ice cream toast
yah so uh what else would you like me to find for you uh-
okay
sentosa has uh one hotel that is not very expensive on the island
so that's the view of the island and the beach is on one side of the island
uh just on the side bar it's eighty nine dollars to two hundred and fifteen dollars yes
five in- and the seventh out okay
some people prefer that uh they go to the uh kampong hut because of the nostalgic uh feelings that it gives them
but if you prefer creature comforts you need your air conditioning then uh the hotel room will be more the regular type of hotel that you will be able to enjoy
okay
it seems like it may be
uh you get- what you get are two double-decker beds
there
and so here you can see the gardens
uh actually i know it opens uh five am in the morning
and we have you know senior citizens it's only one dollar
you could either stop your bus over here at tanglin gates and then you walk in through a lovely garden here and then there is the lake and you can carry on you can see the swans in the lake
and if you go around the corner uh can you see vanda 'miss joaquim'
so that is where we have uh the orchids
because originally when the british came the gardens was used to experiment to see which spice trees what useful plants could be grown here
so uh by some scientific method they have etched gold to the uh real orchid flower
uh you want to have uh the uh zoo is that right
so the orangutan is nearby but it doesn't care for your jam and rolls
there you go
so you're afraid them you need not touch it but you-
and this is the australian outback
and these are fellows from africa uh baboons himalayan hamadryas baboons
so these are some of the animals you see at zoo
so does it attract you or
this is uh the most popular attraction because it is very rare
uh yes that's right
okay
and your name sir
my name is jeanne j e a n n e and i'm tour guide number two
uh you will be at the formula one to watch the races so i think it's better if i get you uh attractions that are near the formula one venue
oh yes of course
uh those prices uh are much higher during the period of the race because that's you know um-
yah and the people who are really keen on uh the race some of them they don't mind spending hundreds of dollars on it
yes
usually it's uh last weekend i think it's the third weekend at the end of the month
uh it is the twenty first twenty second and twenty third
okay
because they are not supplying a breakfast
because they are not supplying a breakfast
and so you can in fact leave on the twenty fourth morning
and so you can in fact leave on the twenty fourth morning
i think at-
we have to wait for the response and see if they have rooms or uh what sort of price
and uh there you can get uh local food
uh i can't see
does it say
so you walk down here and uh at sultan gate palace we have the oldest mosque in singapore you can visit
it's- a kebab is meat that is skewered and-
okay on the last picture here on the- at the top can you see slices of cucumber
uh because the flyer is located uh within view of the race track and uh the flyer is uh very slow moving
yes
fifteen dollars if you can prove you're a student but uh i don't think you're a student right
so there are restaurants around the area
so seafood paradise
that's where you can uh have it
no it's a restaurant
but this hotel here people often go in and take photographs
where the reception of the hotel is now uh it's all been changed but the long bar used to be right at the front of the hotel and it was the longest bar in the whole world at one time
they have lots of mixes but the people who go there uh they go for the singapore sling
yes that's a good idea
yah they are very cute they are the size of uh little rats but they are actually look like deer
they don't spray at you all the time not to worry
yah that's the term
yes a very large memory
so the environment is not forest it's like hilly
but once in the zoo some of them have been bred here they are singapore citizens
you can also take photos with them
but there is also an area where you can see snakes
suddenly you make a turn and there you have a snake right on- you know nearby
yah
uh and one day they found one that was white uh he had gene mutation and uh maharaja or the ruler he started breeding them
and then when the offspring came out you know maybe half white half yellow they- it- they continue to breed until they got the white gene being uh predominant
you- if you walk to the raffles hotel if you had your sling around the corner of raffles hotel uh facing raffles city which is the convention centre uh there's a bus number one three one and it will take you to a place called harbourfront
or do you want you know uh simpler uh souvenirs say from chinatown or from uh the shopping centres
so that's where you can get a variety of uh things to buy
i'll try and see if i can get you some photos uh some photos so you'll have a better idea
but if you're talking about information technology uh there is a centre in singapore where you have uh a lots of these shops so it would be easier for you to pick and choose down there and it is called funan centre
uh it's the first emblem of the singapore tourism board when it was started
we have no record of lions naturally born in singapore so perhaps he saw a tiger which used to roam in our forest or a big deer yah
uh it's-
alright
that there- yes
yah
yah
si~ alright
uh in fact uh sentosa they have a lot of attraction
the admission depends on whether you are coming uh for a weekend or a weekday
the uh- if you have watched the movie called the waterworld
that will be fine if you are coming during the weekend but otherwise a- the whole month is actually okay if you try to come somewhere around in uh the ninth onwards because um sixth and seventh is actually a peak
the train system which will take you from uh universal studio to-
yah
uh on the screen you wanna see
uh you mean uh a few hours of resting or what
uh you mean uh a few hours of resting or what
uh one of the-
yes indeed
yah
uh it's along orchard road here
something really a little bit different and of course uh singapore is one of the first to introduce such night zoo in the world
yah
uh they-
we do have three restaurants which are there
it's an observation wheel which takes uh visitors up for a ride uh so that they can have a good- a nice view of the whole sort of- part of singapore
uh you can see- let me see what i-
you don't even feel that the wheel is moving at all
uh what about east coast beach
uh yes
or you can also go to the merlion park
okay
uh ninety dollars is per room per night
yes of course
this one over here on the-
this is the ancient egypt
it's actually-
it's inside the- for the uh movie
mainly for children
uh unfortunately we do not have a swimming pool there but you can take the ride on the- uh at the lost world where i- where is the rapid adventure is which i have uh told you this morning
it's uh just a small little fountain there uh small little waterfall there we have
you see that is the merlion tower
it's a huge tower which a- there's a lift taking uh the visitors up to the tower uh right all the way up to the lion mouth and also to the lion head
uh four d magix in fact is a ride
it's a four d uh movie ride
you can uh actually use it for your shooting hm
they are using uh- electronic arcade's guns
uh it's not as easy as you think it will be
yah
yah
just in sentosa
and you can probably can try- there's one which is a little bit different
yah
so this one you probably can try if you like some rides
these are the sky ride
this is one of- also a nice attraction in singapore which is also located in sentosa
dolphin eat fish
if you like a little bit adventure this one will be good
yah that's the one which we call the flying fox
so uh plan your holidays get in touch with us again so that we can help you
my name is matthew here
hi melanie my name is matthew and i am tour guide number three
at that particular month we have the formula one speed car racing
uh yes that also depends on uh which hotels you prefer to stay in a budget hotel or you prefer to stay a little bit much more premium hotel then you probably have less spending then
so that will takes off uh two hundred and seventy dollars from you
and the other one which is ew twelve that means that is a east west bound train station number twelve it's actually bugis station
bugis street can you see
and bugis junction bugis tower and bugis village here is one of the other shopping street that you can find uh near to your hotel
from there you can take a walk down and it's not very far away right
food wise uh for food there's a lot of food courts available along your along the hotel that you are staying along jalan besar
so seven pm will be uh- yes
well if you are walking towards ne seven the transportation from ne seven to the vivocity where this uh sentosa uh express is is going to cost you at the most is about three dollars per person so you pay about six dollars
so if you take the train from the sentosa express it's only costing you three dollars
so from there in fact uh if you finish your vis~ uh what you call universal studio you can also take back the same train to vivocity again where you can do your shopping again
nice place to be nice shopping mall
yah
uh well the mrt actually operates from morning uh it ends in the evening the last train leaving is at twelve midnight
uh other places to go to
so for that show- there are two shows happening in the day uh in the evening in fact uh seven forty and eight forty
because sentosa is also a nice place to go
and that will be nice
sometimes they also have a necklace which been designed with uh the indian cursive uh floweries
you can try all those uh local dishes at that area
yah that's why yah i don't see any boats here uh yah
you can have taxi are also available uh buses are also available
uh almost similar like the train
coffee shops are uh they sell coffee in the morning uh they sell toasted bread with eggs half boiled egg or full boiled egg
well there is a website that you can estimate the exchange rate but um you cannot use that rate as the fix rate
yah
but walking along the main street doing the shopping uh it's fine it's quite safe here in singapore
you can see this is how the exchange rate goes right now
yah
what sort of animal are very active during the night time compare to day time like the chimpanzee are quite active during the day time right
you can see uh getting there which i'm gonna click right now
uh right
and you also can get um down by foot from your hotel uh to take a walk there it is not convenient but you can take a bus directly from your hotel
and it opens during the morning five am all the way to twelve midnight
it's a very nice garden uh with lots of beautiful flowers
yah
that's the reason for visiting attraction right
i will suggest you to take the train it's a lot more easier
yah thirty to forty five minutes
because the minute when you uh get out from the airport the train system from the airport is to this station called tanah merah interchange whereby you have to walk across the other platform to pick up the other train towards to your hotel
yah
we do have three airport but this is the only airport which uh have uh flights coming in from- uh passenger flights coming in
it's my pleasure
my name is mathew
saturday and sundays
saturday and sundays
correct
uh right now i'm actually um i guess you are having a screen share with me right now right
but um next to the surrounding of the hotel there is a lot of we call it food court or coffee shops are there
no in fact is hundred and ten is quite cheap uh if it's located at the city area
there are three kind of train system which is available there you know within the walking distance
it's very simple to identify
uh no this is a budget hotel
because if you are looking at swimming then you have to have a full-fledged hotel or something like a three-star or four-star hotel
you can see it from here these are the hotel facilities here
but uh-
and those are available through a phone call away yah
yah
okay
yes the hotel rooms are air conditioner
no of course not
you can take the train system from here
so even you were to go to the north you can get train easily even you wanna go down to um at the west there's also some connecting train which is available
okay you can see that this do come with uh- this do come with a small little pool yes
yah
coffee will be serve to you um i guess breakfast
correct
they- outside yah
and not only that uh goods which are related to the indian community may have not come from indian itself it may uh came from europe
and not only that uh goods which are related to the indian community may have not come from indian itself it may uh came from europe
so um just give me a minute and let's pull out the universal studio for you huh
harbourfront
can you see from the screen
you take the train all the way from little india to the harbourfront which is here
yah so there are-
yah so there are-
yes yap in total it's about yah
if you wanna take it uh take a ride in the comfort manner if you're walking all the way to get sweat in the early morning uh you wanna take a ride quickly to the universal studio you just pay the three dollars for the admission at this sentosa express
then you will reach the summer view hotel and you have to pick up that the sentosa uh shuttle service which is free of charge from there to universal studio
uh if you want to pick up the free shuttle service
no that- no that is the transportation part that you need to pay for your transportation
correct
alright now you can see that the-
the adult fee is seventy four dollars and of course uh you are not senior citizen right
alright now if you will take a look carefully onto the lost world which my uh castle is there
now this lost world come uh with uh theme park uh rides which is required uh the water ride
so in case if you plan to take this ride then you probably have to bring uh one more extra clothing with you
right
then inside there inside the universal studio we also have the um ancient egypt
yah
there are some other rides which are also available there
and if you were to ask me how much time it's gonna take uh let me say that eh since you are going on the uh weekend you uh expected to have uh approximately between nine thirty to five thirty in the whole day
eh seven will be the closing time for the rides
if you want catch the free shuttle bus i would say
uh but that again you have to take the train inwards into the beach station
that can actually uh makes you- eh that can actually uh last your night throughout the whole programme
okay
uh yes
uh no not yet is it
so uh if you were to travel through singapore by air and going out uh through changi airport then you will get the tax refund
yah
so again at this area eh not only that you can do your shopping but you can also visit some tourist attraction at located at this area where we have the kwam im temple which is one of the popular
yah
uh orchard road will be uh a premium place and accommodation wise along orchard road will be a little bit more uh costly i will say
so looking at uh a little bit far away from the city area uh will be fairly between your budget if you are looking at it
it's actually a chain of hotel
but the hotel vicinity you should be able to get uh what you call breakfast easily no problem
yah
it's not included but you have to pay for that
because if you know there's a hotel like that's uh there but how to get towards that place that will be also another big problem for you
so when you go to the ticket counter you can um get the ticket for the bugis uh and you'll get your refund uh of the ticket at the ticketing counter
right
so if you want to catch that attraction you can also walk across towards these suntec city tower one two three and four
uh yes
okay
alright good
and seah street are very popular for it's chicken
so you can get the traditional hainanese chicken rice from there
two years back
alright
now you can see uh on your screen uh right there you have public buses
now the public buses you can pick it up from your- near to your hotel is bus number one hundred
now the other way is you can also pick up some um free shuttle buses
we uh say free shuttle bus means uh provided if you have your passport with you to prove that you are a visitor is singapore you can get a free ride on this shuttle bus okay
alright
i guess so huh
yah
yah
correct
since you are travelling in the month of august you'll find that a lot of them are in orange in colour that means that is non-peak
but the one which is green in colour that is peak because it's during the weekend
but the one which is green in colour that is peak because it's during the weekend
alright
the express pass actually helps you to ease the long waiting queue time on any of the rides or attractions or movies alright
yah along and wasting your time in the uh queuing up for the rides yah
it's a school holiday in singapore
so that is the reason why this is a full green and a full rate
especially during the peak and the super peak uh they only allow about eight thousand visitors inside the universal studio
you can see the uh blue and you can also see the red
yah a chasing ride right
so that chasing ride has actually put onto this sci-fi centre which we call the battlestar galactica cylon- human versus cylon
the speed of the roller coaster is at eighty two point eight kilometres per hour
so if- yah decepticons yah
okay
how to get there is to take the sentosa express from the universal studio two stops away and it will lead you to beach station
yah
ye~ uh yes marina bay is- marina bay sands is quite near to the racing track of the formula one it's not in front of the racing track
so if you want to see marina bay sand then i'm viewing you this
and this is marina bay sand
now marina bay sand is also not very far away from your hotel
now i'm going to go to the other screen uh where the train system is
and from promenade to bayfront which is the marina bay sand this is the stop so one stop away
alright
alright
right
good afternoon
what you like to see more in singapore
okay
okay now uh there is a hotel which is quite uh nearby to what i think you might like but of course i would like to highlight to you that this hotel is located somewhere near to little india
i think that's okay
you see- ah okay there you are
which month you do plan to come to singapore
which month
right
as you can see the facilities uh for the hotel uh uh there's a coffee shops which are there
uh if you wanna take a look i will pull it this thing up
oh is it yah
uh i re~- i guess this you better check it out with the hotel itself
uh that-
okay now- so we first go for the fragrance hotel yah
and this is not far away from bugis
you can see the magenta in colour right
okay now good
right
now you can see that the hotel is here and the train system ew twelve
now you can see that the hotel is here and the train system ew twelve
so right now i'm gonna go back to bugis alright
so from the bugis station towards your hotel it's gonna be about fifteen- ten to fifteen minutes' walk
so- that depends on what you want
in little india mainly cater for the indian taste
so if you have to move towards bugis you'll find that uh a lot of things you can pick it up at bugis junction at bugis village
so you can see your hotel now
next to fortune centre is where uh the chocolate factory is
yes indeed
at night
even though if you are slightly early probably you can catch our magician shows at the clarke quay called uh the arena yah
yah it's not there
so you- in fact you can uh be the- you can go there by uh transportation through the mrt station
yah it's quite near
so you see the thing is if you choose the right hotel uh going from one place to another is quite easy
but uh you also have to bear in mind that the train system only operates at five thirty in the morning and the last train leave the terminal would be at twelve midnight
huh
now um from clarke quay uh station you can just walk down towards this river bank and i guess this bridge will a lot uh more popular to you right
because this is the kingsbridge whereby lots of the uh people will be drinking bottles or cans of beer at that time using this bridge
i know in fact um it's pub has a dancing um you know dancing floor
yah order-
you can also have your meal first then you have drink then you party
and that doesn't mean say you should finish it before that time
yah or otherwise if you like more rocks and pops then you probably have to go to saint james powerstation
now that is why quite near to the sentosa island and if you were to take the train towards uh that area uh leads you to saint james powerstation which is um- you can take the same train from your little india from your hotel to this
okay
yes
so these are more to hip hops and raps
and the first drink is free
so that if you don't like this pub uh now you can go the other pub behind it without paying any cover charge
so i want to go to some classical
we call it zero degrees tiger beer
we call it zero degrees tiger beer
and i find it a little bit much more comfortable
even i'm not a drinker but um it give me a good sense of you know uh taste
the rains come and go within about an hour or two
i just pull back to your hotel so that you can see where i'm talking about and-
and you can see from here right
now right in front of your hotel there is a bus stop
right
probably it will cost you at the most about a dollar for the bus ride
but uh the what you call uh the singapore botanical garden opens at five and it close in the middle- midnight yah
and of course- morning
five am in the morning
so you-
yah
his name are-
yah you can go there also right
you are not dining in a food court
alright
yah
ben and jerry's
ice cream
you can get it from here
uh what do yo~ what else would you want
i guess that one thousand dollar should be just nice for you yah
