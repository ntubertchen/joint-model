like you know it's like if you've been to singapore you have to really taste this or eat this ***next*** alright ***next*** okay ***next*** like ***next*** 
yes ***next*** if ***next*** is that the signature dish of singapore ***next*** okay ***next*** 
is that the signature dish of singapore ***next*** okay ***next*** uh yes ***next*** because uh a lot of people likes to eat this food including the local people as well ***next*** 
because uh a lot of people likes to eat this food including the local people as well ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** um and of course uh pepper crabs as well ***next*** 
okay ***next*** um and of course uh pepper crabs as well ***next*** okay ***next*** uh so i think we ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh so i think we ***next*** the locals here generally if we have friends coming over ***next*** we like to introduce them to these uh dishes ***next*** 
it's ***next*** yah ***next*** i will ***next*** the hawker food ***next*** 
i will ***next*** the hawker food ***next*** yes ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah maybe you could also you know give us an idea on ***next*** you know where we should go to you know have a try on that place ***next*** right ***next*** 
yah maybe you could also you know give us an idea on ***next*** you know where we should go to you know have a try on that place ***next*** right ***next*** okay ***next*** 
right ***next*** okay ***next*** and ***next*** alright maybe i can do a recommendation now ***next*** 
okay ***next*** um okay if like if you arrived in the airport ***next*** we have three terminals at the moment ***next*** um so you probably arrive let's say terminal one changi airport ***next*** 
we have three terminals at the moment ***next*** um so you probably arrive let's say terminal one changi airport ***next*** okay ***next*** that's located on the eastern part of singapore ***next*** 
um so you probably arrive let's say terminal one changi airport ***next*** okay ***next*** that's located on the eastern part of singapore ***next*** and you will be checking in to the hotel ***next*** 
let's say if you are putting up in the orchard road hotel ***next*** uh that is like about thirty minutes' drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels ***next*** okay ***next*** so there are quite a number of hotels there ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so there are quite a number of hotels there ***next*** so again it depends on your budget ***next*** it's like one straight road ***next*** 
it's like one straight road ***next*** okay ***next*** and that's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there ***next*** as well as the uh buses and it is also the main shopping belt ***next*** 
okay ***next*** can i ***next*** all items ***next*** yes ***next*** 
go ahead ***next*** uh i was ***next*** okay ***next*** uh so i was thinking also maybe uh since you have only one day in singapore ***next*** 
mrt ***next*** okay ***next*** correct ***next*** so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport you can go to the subway train station ***next*** 
okay ***next*** correct ***next*** so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport you can go to the subway train station ***next*** you just look for direction ***next*** 
so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport you can go to the subway train station ***next*** you just look for direction ***next*** it's pretty clear ***next*** uh you look for the direction that says uh city train ***next*** 
you just look for direction ***next*** it's pretty clear ***next*** uh you look for the direction that says uh city train ***next*** and you go down uh to the train station and you can buy uh a tourist card ***next*** 
uh you look for the direction that says uh city train ***next*** and you go down uh to the train station and you can buy uh a tourist card ***next*** or ***next*** okay since it's only one day i think what you can do is you just buy a standard card ***next*** 
and you go down uh to the train station and you can buy uh a tourist card ***next*** or ***next*** okay since it's only one day i think what you can do is you just buy a standard card ***next*** uh on this train it's actually uh eastwest line ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so this is um from the east you'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station ***next*** okay ***next*** so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day ***next*** i would recommend that you stay in the uh city hall ***next*** there are two hotels there for you to choose ***next*** 
okay ***next*** um may i have a ***next*** do you have an idea lynnette like how much does it cost in that hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** 
um singaporean dollar ***next*** so um let's say that um given my budget so maybe i have to um have more money for ***next*** but if it would be me my husband and my son that would be considered as a package tour right ***next*** uh not necessary ***next*** 
okay ***next*** you can actually just come in take the subway to the hotel ***next*** and uh you can do a one way tour ***next*** and i will do a few recommendation for you uh so you don't have to spend that much money ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so let's say it's uh the three of us and then i only have one thousand dollars ***next*** so let's um so if we do with the hotel which cost you said three hundred dollars right ***next*** yes ***next*** 
right ***next*** okay ***next*** so the three hundred dollars is already good for the three of us if like we stay in one room ***next*** yes ***next*** 
and then we'll uh ***next*** i think we'll just go ahead and take the subway then ***next*** because i think that's much cheaper if uh compared to riding a taxi correct ***next*** yes ***next*** 
i think we'll just go ahead and take the subway then ***next*** because i think that's much cheaper if uh compared to riding a taxi correct ***next*** yes ***next*** because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about ***next*** 
yes ***next*** because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about ***next*** again depending on the timing that you have arrive ***next*** uh in the region of let's say forty dollars ***next*** 
so all the prices i'm quoting you will be in singapore dollars ***next*** okay ***next*** so mrt you mentioned that i just have to buy a standard card ***next*** yes ***next*** 
yes ***next*** okay and how much does the standard card um cost ***next*** okay and how much does the standard card um cost ***next*** okay ***next*** 
okay ***next*** it depends on which uh particular location that you are going to ***next*** okay ***next*** uh so let's say we will have to choose ***next*** 
it depends on which uh particular location that you are going to ***next*** okay ***next*** uh so let's say we will have to choose ***next*** let's say now maybe i'll just talk to you first before i show you the map the city map ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh so let's say we will have to choose ***next*** let's say now maybe i'll just talk to you first before i show you the map the city map ***next*** uh and also some hotels ***next*** 
let's say now maybe i'll just talk to you first before i show you the map the city map ***next*** uh and also some hotels ***next*** okay sure ***next*** alright ***next*** 
uh and also some hotels ***next*** okay sure ***next*** alright ***next*** so it all depends alright ***next*** 
okay sure ***next*** alright ***next*** so it all depends alright ***next*** the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars uh to ***next*** 
alright ***next*** so it all depends alright ***next*** the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars uh to ***next*** let's say three dollars ***next*** 
so it all depends alright ***next*** the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars uh to ***next*** let's say three dollars ***next*** but because if you are buying a standard card there is actually a dollar deposit ***next*** 
but because if you are buying a standard card there is actually a dollar deposit ***next*** okay ***next*** so let's say if the taxi ***next*** the mrt cost one dollar for example then you will have to put two dollars into the machine ***next*** 
the mrt cost one dollar for example then you will have to put two dollars into the machine ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** so i will suggest that when you are ***next*** 
yah ***next*** so i will suggest that when you are ***next*** let's say your husband is trying to get ***next*** uh retrieve the bags uh at the conveyor belt ***next*** 
let's say your husband is trying to get ***next*** uh retrieve the bags uh at the conveyor belt ***next*** at the belts ***next*** uh there are also money changer inside uh the airport area ***next*** 
at the belts ***next*** uh there are also money changer inside uh the airport area ***next*** okay ***next*** so maybe one can take care of the bags ***next*** 
okay ***next*** so maybe one can take care of the bags ***next*** uh the other person will go and change some money first ***next*** some singapore money ***next*** 
uh the other person will go and change some money first ***next*** some singapore money ***next*** okay ***next*** just uh change a little bit of money just for your meals ***next*** 
some singapore money ***next*** okay ***next*** just uh change a little bit of money just for your meals ***next*** in the hotel uh in the hawker centres ***next*** 
alright ***next*** as well as for the ride to the hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** 
as well as for the ride to the hotel ***next*** okay ***next*** alright ***next*** so i estimated ***next*** 
okay ***next*** alright ***next*** so i estimated ***next*** maybe you can change about singapore dollars two hundred dollars first ***next*** 
maybe you can change about singapore dollars two hundred dollars first ***next*** alright ***next*** two hundred dollars first ***next*** yah ***next*** 
alright ***next*** two hundred dollars first ***next*** yah ***next*** uh or anything more but i think this is just for my recommendation ***next*** 
two hundred dollars first ***next*** yah ***next*** uh or anything more but i think this is just for my recommendation ***next*** just some money to get by for the short while ***next*** 
just some money to get by for the short while ***next*** you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier ***next*** okay ***next*** or if you're going to stay in near any of the shopping centres uh there's always a money changer in the shopping centre ***next*** 
you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier ***next*** okay ***next*** or if you're going to stay in near any of the shopping centres uh there's always a money changer in the shopping centre ***next*** so you can always change your money there ***next*** 
okay ***next*** got it ***next*** thank you ***next*** yah ***next***

on the twenty sixth uh and then you stay overnight the next day ***next*** oh ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** 
oh ***next*** okay ***next*** yah ***next*** or of course if you can have a bit more time you can arrive prior to twenty sixth twenty fifth ***next*** 
okay ***next*** yah ***next*** or of course if you can have a bit more time you can arrive prior to twenty sixth twenty fifth ***next*** and then you leave on the twenty seventh ***next*** 
and then you leave on the twenty seventh ***next*** uh hm yah ***next*** i think i'll go with the twenty fifth and then will have you know um twenty sixth ***next*** yes ***next*** 
i think that's much better ***next*** yah ***next*** okay ***next*** so you will have like a two night stay in singapore ***next*** 
okay ***next*** uh so from the hotel okay so um you mentioned that it's only thirty minutes uh from the hotel to get to ***next*** i mean from the airport to get to the hotel is that correct ***next*** okay from ***next*** 
i mean from the airport to get to the hotel is that correct ***next*** okay from ***next*** if you're taking the subway ***next*** uh because this is a eastwest line um you will have to change uh the line in city hall ***next*** 
okay from ***next*** if you're taking the subway ***next*** uh because this is a eastwest line um you will have to change uh the line in city hall ***next*** uh so i think better that you reserve forty five minutes ***next*** 
yah ***next*** alright ***next*** it's pretty frequent ***next*** uh so of course to be very detailed ***next*** 
alright ***next*** it's pretty frequent ***next*** uh so of course to be very detailed ***next*** uh always check with the information counter at the mrt train station ***next***

the bird park the night safari river safari and the singapore zoo ***next*** these are all different places am i correct ***next*** yes that's right they ***next*** because they are run under one organisation known as wildlife reserves ***next*** 
these are all different places am i correct ***next*** yes that's right they ***next*** because they are run under one organisation known as wildlife reserves ***next*** so it is one ***next*** 
and ***next*** okay ***next*** um for all of them ***next*** yes for all of them ***next***

um for all of them ***next*** yes for all of them ***next*** normally you have a month to use up the ticket but ***next*** so if you're staying just two or three days you would definitely use it up ***next***

and it takes you from one part of the zoo ***next*** to another part ***next*** and you're lucky because it has just opened ***next*** so of course you're not going to go to all those rivers that was shown just now ***next*** 
baby crocodile here ***next*** so what other activities do you have um in the river safari ***next*** will there be boat rides available ***next*** yes you take the boat and you can see the exhibits ***next*** 
so what other activities do you have um in the river safari ***next*** will there be boat rides available ***next*** yes you take the boat and you can see the exhibits ***next*** and on the boat ride the guide will show you um you know the skin ***next***

the moult of the uh snakes ***next*** things that you don't normally see when you uh just visit a zoo ***next*** but when you take the ride you can see exhibits that they have collected ***next*** you know when the animals die they have these specimens ***next*** 
now the panda that you just saw ***next*** they have not yet come ***next*** uh okay ***next*** but they are coming okay ***next***

they had a river ride all along but now they have enhanced it ***next*** oh i see ***next*** so you see at the bottom there the different zones ***next*** so they are trying to recreate these zones within the river safari ***next*** 
so you see at the bottom there the different zones ***next*** so they are trying to recreate these zones within the river safari ***next*** it seems to me as if this is gonna be a very big place ***next*** uh yes it is ***next*** 
it seems to me as if this is gonna be a very big place ***next*** uh yes it is ***next*** uh it's uh forty hectares if i remember correctly the riv~ ***next*** the whole zoo ***next*** 
uh it's uh forty hectares if i remember correctly the riv~ ***next*** the whole zoo ***next*** oh my goodness ***next*** yah ***next***

night safari gives you uh very magical feel ***next*** because here we have nocturnal animals ***next*** and also some animals that are both nocturnal and diurnal ***next*** so we have settle lighting uh at where they feed ***next*** 
because here we have nocturnal animals ***next*** and also some animals that are both nocturnal and diurnal ***next*** so we have settle lighting uh at where they feed ***next*** and then they will put food at these places ***next*** 
and also some animals that are both nocturnal and diurnal ***next*** so we have settle lighting uh at where they feed ***next*** and then they will put food at these places ***next*** it's actually token feeding ***next*** 
so we have settle lighting uh at where they feed ***next*** and then they will put food at these places ***next*** it's actually token feeding ***next*** it's to encourage the animals to be in the light so you can see ***next***

so this is probably something i have to put on my agenda when i go to singapore ***next*** you can take photos in the zoo and the bird park ***next*** but not at the night safari uh at the animals ***next*** you can take when they are doing the show ***next*** 
you can take photos in the zoo and the bird park ***next*** but not at the night safari uh at the animals ***next*** you can take when they are doing the show ***next*** you can take cozying in the open areas but not at the animals ***next***

they are orangutans ***next*** that you normally have to go into the forest to see ***next*** uh but here some of them are actually bred in our zoo ***next*** and they are trained so they come out ***next*** 
that you normally have to go into the forest to see ***next*** uh but here some of them are actually bred in our zoo ***next*** and they are trained so they come out ***next*** and you can take a photograph with them even your daughter ***next***

um these orangutans that you've shown me here ***next*** they don't like um grab the food on your plate when you're having breakfast do they ***next*** uh no ***next*** because uh where you're eating is separate from where they are ***next*** 
they don't like um grab the food on your plate when you're having breakfast do they ***next*** uh no ***next*** because uh where you're eating is separate from where they are ***next*** and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating ***next*** 
so they don't come and help themselves to your food ***next*** you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area ***next*** and you're looking at i think some lemurs at the back ***next*** there will be butterflies fluttering birds flying around ***next*** 
you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area ***next*** and you're looking at i think some lemurs at the back ***next*** there will be butterflies fluttering birds flying around ***next*** it's an open area to show you the ecosystem in a forest ***next*** 
and you're looking at i think some lemurs at the back ***next*** there will be butterflies fluttering birds flying around ***next*** it's an open area to show you the ecosystem in a forest ***next*** uh so the specimens inside or rather the exhibits inside there ***next*** 
there will be butterflies fluttering birds flying around ***next*** it's an open area to show you the ecosystem in a forest ***next*** uh so the specimens inside or rather the exhibits inside there ***next*** are all tamed and quite friendly ***next*** 
yup ***next*** yup ***next*** hm i see ***next*** and we have the sea lions that do a show ***next*** 
yup i'm definitely there ***next*** i'm looking at the pictures and i am thinking of the activities that ***next*** you know we'd probably do when we get there ***next*** yah ***next*** 
i'm looking at the pictures and i am thinking of the activities that ***next*** you know we'd probably do when we get there ***next*** yah ***next*** you can volunteer uh your daughter ***next***

oh yes ***next*** especially yes having your wedding anniversary ***next*** so shall i show you ***next*** you were asking about ticketing right ***next*** 
you were asking about ticketing right ***next*** yup ***next*** yes ma'am ***next*** uh oh just hold on a minute ***next*** 
yes ma'am ***next*** uh oh just hold on a minute ***next*** oh i think it's ***next*** wait ***next*** 
oh i think it's ***next*** wait ***next*** okay ***next*** can you see the park hoppers' specials ***next*** 
can you see the park hoppers' specials ***next*** yup ***next*** so three in one ***next*** because if you go to all three parks you are paying only fifty eight dollars ***next*** 
because if you go to all three parks you are paying only fifty eight dollars ***next*** alright ***next*** and if you visit just the night safari and zoo it's forty eight ***next*** there is a saving ***next*** 
alright ***next*** and if you visit just the night safari and zoo it's forty eight ***next*** there is a saving ***next*** because the individual tickets are costed at a higher price ***next*** 
there is a saving ***next*** because the individual tickets are costed at a higher price ***next*** alright i got that ***next*** and you see you can use it within a month ***next*** 
because the individual tickets are costed at a higher price ***next*** alright i got that ***next*** and you see you can use it within a month ***next*** within thirty days ***next*** 
alright i got that ***next*** and you see you can use it within a month ***next*** within thirty days ***next*** s~ ***next*** 
and you see you can use it within a month ***next*** within thirty days ***next*** s~ ***next*** the only thing is it doesn't ***next*** 
s~ ***next*** the only thing is it doesn't ***next*** uh oh it includes the night safari tram ride ***next*** but uh not the tram ride within the day zoo ***next*** 
uh oh it includes the night safari tram ride ***next*** but uh not the tram ride within the day zoo ***next*** so if you want to take a tram within the singapore zoo in the day time ***next*** you have to pay about five dollars or so for the tram ride ***next*** 
so if you want to take a tram within the singapore zoo in the day time ***next*** you have to pay about five dollars or so for the tram ride ***next*** alright got that ***next*** you can also walk uh after you do your tram ride if you have time ***next*** 
you have to pay about five dollars or so for the tram ride ***next*** alright got that ***next*** you can also walk uh after you do your tram ride if you have time ***next*** because then you can see uh on the night safari different set of animals ***next*** 
alright got that ***next*** you can also walk uh after you do your tram ride if you have time ***next*** because then you can see uh on the night safari different set of animals ***next*** and the day zoo she can get closer up to all the animals ***next*** 
but i'm actually reading the answer from what you're showing me ***next*** so it says there that visits to the three park need not be in one day ***next*** so i got my answer just right there ***next*** yah ***next*** 
thirty days to use it up ***next*** so you could even take one at a time ***next*** right ***next*** but if you go to the night safari and the zoo uh at the same time ***next*** 
so you could even take one at a time ***next*** right ***next*** but if you go to the night safari and the zoo uh at the same time ***next*** because they are next to each other ***next*** 
right ***next*** but if you go to the night safari and the zoo uh at the same time ***next*** because they are next to each other ***next*** you save on the fare and the time ***next*** 
but if you go to the night safari and the zoo uh at the same time ***next*** because they are next to each other ***next*** you save on the fare and the time ***next*** you save time travelling ***next*** 
because they are next to each other ***next*** you save on the fare and the time ***next*** you save time travelling ***next*** you can visit the zoo starting from morning 'till evening ***next*** 
you save on the fare and the time ***next*** you save time travelling ***next*** you can visit the zoo starting from morning 'till evening ***next*** or you can visit it in the afternoon 'till about six o'clock ***next*** 
you save time travelling ***next*** you can visit the zoo starting from morning 'till evening ***next*** or you can visit it in the afternoon 'till about six o'clock ***next*** and then just walk across to the night safari ***next*** 
i see ***next*** okay ***next*** okay ***next*** uh do you want to see pictures of the tram ride ***next***

but then it's a single room ***next*** single room for under fifty dollars ***next*** i think that's a bit tough ***next*** uh that's a bit tough ***next*** 
i think that's a bit tough ***next*** uh that's a bit tough ***next*** yah ***next*** closer to a hundred dollars ***next*** 
uh that's a bit tough ***next*** yah ***next*** closer to a hundred dollars ***next*** you might be able to get a room uh of your own ***next*** 
oh so if you spent ***next*** uh oh you mean if you s~ ***next*** your ticket is two hundred and fifty dollars ***next*** you have seven hundred and fifty dollars left ***next*** 
and then the two hundred ***next*** the two hundred fifty dollars for the um for the room accommodation ***next*** for the hotel accommodation ***next*** that's ***next***

let me try and find one for you ***next*** uh but two hundred and fifty is actually a very great ***next*** good great hotel ***next*** you don't really need two hundred and fifty dollars ***next*** 
okay ***next*** and for two hundred fifty dollars ***next*** uh do i get two nights or just one night ***next*** in some hotels you would be able to get two nights ***next*** 
uh do i get two nights or just one night ***next*** in some hotels you would be able to get two nights ***next*** okay ***next*** so let's say less than a hundred dollars ***next***

the race line ***next*** oh if you do that you will bust your budget ***next*** uh because if you ***next*** the hotel rates will go up during that time for the budget class hotels ***next*** 
so even though if i book in advance ***next*** let's say a few weeks from now ***next*** even though you book in advan~ ***next*** no ***next*** 
no ***next*** even though you book in advance ***next*** because the hotels know that it's a very popular period ***next*** and they also have to pay a small fee as a tax ***next*** 
even though you book in advance ***next*** because the hotels know that it's a very popular period ***next*** and they also have to pay a small fee as a tax ***next*** uh so they bill it into the room rates ***next*** 
because the hotels know that it's a very popular period ***next*** and they also have to pay a small fee as a tax ***next*** uh so they bill it into the room rates ***next*** so i think your priority to ***next***

uh and if you go the other way you are into chinatown ***next*** a little bit further up ***next*** dhoby ghaut is a major interchange where you see three little circles ***next*** so three lines pass through there ***next*** 
a little bit further up ***next*** dhoby ghaut is a major interchange where you see three little circles ***next*** so three lines pass through there ***next*** and so if you take the northeast ***next*** 
dhoby ghaut is a major interchange where you see three little circles ***next*** so three lines pass through there ***next*** and so if you take the northeast ***next*** uh sorry the northsouth line the red line ***next***

the whole ride without stopping will take you about forty minutes ***next*** but if you make a stop midway and you walked uh the leopard's trail ***next*** uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail ***next*** and when you finished the trail you come back to the tram station ***next*** 
uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail ***next*** and when you finished the trail you come back to the tram station ***next*** and you board the next tram back to the entrance ***next*** and if you still are energetic enough you can still do another walking trail ***next***

for~ ***next*** uh that's the september period ***next*** uh you will be at the formula one to watch the races ***next*** so i think it's better if i get you uh attractions that are near the formula one venue ***next*** 
just near or like uh in a hotel or um a place ***next*** which is just a walking distance from the race track ***next*** okay yes ***next*** that's very wise because if you take public transports um some of the roads are closed off ***next***

maybe right now if we can book them so that we can uh maybe save something um ***next*** uh as compared to uh booking them right before the race weekend ***next*** uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it's near impossible ***next*** it will be fully booked already ***next*** 
uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it's near impossible ***next*** it will be fully booked already ***next*** yah i know ***next*** yah ***next***
