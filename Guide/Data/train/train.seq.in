okay you will be arriving at singapore on the twenty fifth i guess
so that you can spend twenty sixth of august here
alright
and um you will be taking a flight in uh do you also need me to like advise you how do you get from the airport
and i presume you'll be staying in a hotel as well
and i presume you'll be staying in a hotel as well
okay and you will probably leave singapore on the twenty seventh
okay
okay so uh what are your son like any theme park or what is he like
what does he prefer
what does he prefer
yes
uh okay
and your husband does he like uh
alright
okay
like- like chili crabs
okay
uh yes
uh yes
because uh a lot of people likes to eat this food including the local people as well
um and of course uh pepper crabs as well
uh so i think we- the locals here generally if we have friends coming over- we like to introduce them to these uh dishes
yes
okay
right
okay
um okay if like if you arrived in the airport we have three terminals at the moment
um so you probably arrive let's say terminal one changi airport
um so you probably arrive let's say terminal one changi airport
that's located on the eastern part of singapore
that's located on the eastern part of singapore
that's located on the eastern part of singapore
and you will be checking in to the hotel
let's say if you are putting up in the orchard road hotel
uh that is like about thirty minutes' drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels
uh that is like about thirty minutes' drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels
so there are quite a number of hotels there
so there are quite a number of hotels there
so again it depends on your budget
it's like one straight road
and that's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there
and that's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there
as well as the uh buses and it is also the main shopping belt
as well as the uh buses and it is also the main shopping belt
okay
all items-
yes
okay
uh so i was thinking also maybe uh since you have only one day in singapore
so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport you can go to the subway train station
so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport you can go to the subway train station
you just look for direction
you just look for direction
uh you look for the direction that says uh city train
and you go down uh to the train station and you can buy uh a tourist card
and you go down uh to the train station and you can buy uh a tourist card
uh on this train it's actually uh east-west line
so this is um from the east you'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station
so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day
so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day
i would recommend that you stay in the uh city hall
i would recommend that you stay in the uh city hall
uh it's about in the region of singapore dollars
uh it's about in the region of singapore dollars
uh three hundred dollars per room
alright
uh not necessary
you can actually just come in take the subway to the hotel
and uh you can do a one way tour and i will do a few recommendation for you uh so you don't have to spend that much money
yes
right
yes
yes
because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about- again depending on the timing that you have arrive uh in the region of let's say forty dollars- singapore dollars
because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about- again depending on the timing that you have arrive uh in the region of let's say forty dollars- singapore dollars
so all the prices i'm quoting you will be in singapore dollars
yes
okay
uh so let's say we will have to choose
uh and also some hotels
alright
so it all depends alright
the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars uh to- let's say three dollars
but because if you are buying a standard card there is actually a dollar deposit
yah
so i will suggest that when you are- let's say your husband is trying to get- uh retrieve the bags uh at the conveyor belt
at the belts
uh there are also money changer inside uh the airport area
uh there are also money changer inside uh the airport area
so maybe one can take care of the bags
uh the other person will go and change some money first
some singapore money
just uh change a little bit of money just for your meals in the hotel uh in the hawker centres
as well as for the ride to the hotel
alright
so i estimated
maybe you can change about singapore dollars two hundred dollars first
maybe you can change about singapore dollars two hundred dollars first
yah
uh or anything more but i think this is just for my recommendation
just some money to get by for the short while
you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier
you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier
or if you're going to stay in near any of the shopping centres uh there's always a money changer in the shopping centre
so you can always change your money there
so you can always change your money there
yes
right
so i mean if you are going to- because it's a short flight from philippines so you can arrive in the morning on saturday uh on the twenty sixth uh and then you stay overnight the next day
yah
or of course if you can have a bit more time you can arrive prior to twenty sixth twenty fifth
and then you leave on the twenty seventh
and then you leave on the twenty seventh
yes
yah
so you will have like a two night stay in singapore
so you will have like a two night stay in singapore
okay from- if you're taking the subway-
uh because this is a east-west line um you will have to change uh the line in city hall
uh so i think better that you reserve forty five minutes
uh so i think better that you reserve forty five minutes
yah
it's pretty frequent
uh so of course to be very detailed
uh always check with the information counter at the mrt train station
we call our subway the mrt
we call our subway the mrt
yah
so there are like certain hotels you can stay
so there are like certain hotels you can stay
uh maybe the landmark hotel over at the- near to the bugis area
uh maybe the landmark hotel over at the- near to the bugis area
yah
um okay
this is just a normal kind of a hotel
this is just a normal kind of a hotel
uh so they do have uh quite a lot of family staying in this hotel as well
uh yah
so i don't think you will require like any special uh items for the- for your child right
because the whole day you'll be out
yes
uh yah it's pretty convenient
uh yah it's pretty convenient
because again you can take the subway
so what you do is- okay let's say we skip the arrival part right
i mean that's done right
i mean that's done right
you are quite uh you know what's going on from your airport you take the subway-
you are quite uh you know what's going on from your airport you take the subway-
to the hotel
and uh so let's say we start on the twenty sixth
and uh so let's say we start on the twenty sixth
try some local food
try some local food
yes on the twenty sixth itself
yes on the twenty sixth itself
uh of course if you want to have the hotel breakfast you can always- because most of the time breakfast will be included in your hotel package
uh of course if you want to have the hotel breakfast you can always- because most of the time breakfast will be included in your hotel package
okay
if you decide not to do it not to take the hotel breakfast
i would suggest that you come out from the hotel
just go across the road
there is a little uh coffee shop
oh that's great
so what you can do is you just go across the road
so what you can do is you just go across the road
there are small cafes just across your road- the road

yah
and uh-
yah
so you can try that
and they have another dish called murtabak

and you can eat it with your hands just like the locals
it's a piece of pancake
it's a piece of pancake
you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry
you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry
alright
so you can have that for breakfast it's quite a filling dish
so maybe i'll suggest that uh a one piece it depends on what kind of meat you order
it ranges from five dollars- singapore dollars onwards
it ranges from five dollars- singapore dollars onwards
so you can order just two pieces to try or maybe you can try that
and you can also uh do a bee hoon goreng
it's like fried uh noodles
it's like fried uh noodles
so you just order a small- uh two dish is fine for 3 person
alright
quite- big
yes it's quite big
and you can also have uh one of our tea
um it's like a pull tea
tea with milk and they pull the tea
so you have a lot of foam on your tea
so that is- this is something very local as well
yes so you can have that
and then you just walk towards the subway uh which will be the bugis mrt
and you take the subway uh to the harbourfront
okay
yes no problem
uh majority of us here speaks english uh because english is our first language and all our sign are all in english
yes
so if there's any uh problem you need directions please feel free to approach anybody that looks like a local
i think there's some- yah
yah so it's not a real issue
because again uh from your hotel to the uh- to harbourfront where you're going to- i would say that i think you'll just do universal studio on sentosa on the twenty sixth
so you will have to change your mrt ride over at dhoby ghaut because that will be the uh north east line
yah
so i think the detailed part i think we should- you should be able to work it out right
yah
yes
uh okay no all our mrt we have this map out there
we have a map
we have a map
okay
so there are a few lines okay from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong

then we have the north to the south line
then we have the north to the south line

and then i will show you the sentosa map
alright they are already included in your fare
yes it's an island just about one kilometre away from the mainland
yes it's an island just about one kilometre away from the mainland
uh it's on the southern part of singapore
uh it's on the southern part of singapore
so i think now you can see the map the whole map now
okay
okay and you see uh tall tower and then there's something down that has a little bit of u
okay so you can take the cable car alright across
i think yah that's a nice ride here
i think yah that's a nice ride here
okay and on sentosa you see all these roads
okay
uh you can travel on the buses- sentosa buses
okay and they are colour coded as well
but uh again you just look at where you are going to
so i would suggest that you go to the lagoon
okay can you see siloso beach
can you see my arrow
okay
so you can do the beach out here for early morning swim
yes spend about uh one hour
yes spend about uh one hour
alright
and then you can go to universal studio
yes it's on sentosa itself

so it's actually over this side
okay and of course it's like a theme park

yes
yah it's fine
it's just a few dollars difference
it's a birthday treat
right
yah
so you can do uh- uh there are quite a few shows there as well
there are few shows that you can do
uh there's a madagascar there is this uh the ride in the movie transformer
i think your son will like that
yes
so that is a nice uh ride to do
uh and of course there are other shows and- i think i will suggest that lunch you just have a meal in universal studio itself
because you know it takes time to come out and then go in again
because you know it takes time to come out and then go in again
so i'll just- i will suggest that lunch you have it in universal studio
so they have like fast food available
uh so maybe just a quick lunch like a sandwich or something
and then carry on
depending on how much uh your son would like to stay in there
how much time he wants to spend there right
how much time he wants to spend there right
so because the uh universal studio opening hours it's from ten am to seven pm
yah
that's right
so you could spend like let's say from ten o'clock you know if you go early in the morning for your swim
or even if you don't want to swim just take a walk in the bea- uh in- around the beach area
and then you just take a sentosa bus to the universal studio or you can also take the uh what do you call that
alright
uh those are all included so you don't have to pay extra money
uh those are all included so you don't have to pay extra money
uh then you go to universal studio spend let's say from ten or ten thirty onwards right up to about five thirty
or even six
and then you go for your dinner with the chili crabs
alright
so from there you- again you can take the subway to the clarke quay
from harbourfront to clarke quay
okay there are quite a few restaurants there
uh and you can have your chili crabs out there
right
yes
right
alright you can go to this place
alright you can go to this place
uh again if you're going to stay in the lavender mrt area
uh again if you're going to stay in the lavender mrt area
uh it's just like two station away from where you are
um you go to funan centre
uh they have all the gadgets out there
so maybe if you- before you come you know you can always check on the prices first
and uh because there are so many shops out there that sells similar items so they are pretty- uh i would say very attractive prices
yah
yes so what you- maybe they may not be able to give you like a lot of discount
uh but they can always give you freebies because they know that if you go into the shop and you walked out you'll probably end up buying from someone else
so it's quite reputable the shops there
so it's quite reputable the shops there
so i will recommend like this location so you can do your shopping out there
and let's say your- you can leave your husband there for yourself- oh yourself or- i'm sorry your husband and your son if your son is interested in a technical product
then what you do is you walk over to city hall mrt
then what you do is you walk over to city hall mrt
and you do your shopping out there
and you do your shopping out there
because you're just ten minutes away from one another
because you're just ten minutes away from one another
yah
yah
yes
so you have- uh in the raffles place- uh sorry raffles city because it's just above the city hall mrt
uh they have from the branded alright like the gucci and everything else
right up to the midrange products
so it's uh about three three levels of shopping
and also we have an underground shopping area uh called citylink
alright
so they have all- yes they have all your shoes your clothes
toiletries cosmetics everything is in there
it's not like the street kind of uh shopping
so the quality is good i would say
so it all depends
let's say if you are buying the branded product i think here in singapore we are still relatively affordable
uh and uh if you are buying the midrange products uh they are in uh i would say a good condition
alright
and on top of that you can always claim back the gst the goods and services tax
which is like uh seven per cent
and it's so easy you know
you- once you arrived back in the airport when you are leaving singapore you just produce the receipt that has been stamped uh sorry
uh that is given by the retailer
and let's say if you are putting your purchases in your luggage so you have that checked by uh officials before you check in your bags
alright
so if you are buying smaller items like uh jewellery watches then you can have your uh gst refund um just before you board the plane
once you cleared the immigration you look out for this sign that says gst and you can claim back your money immediately if you like
once you cleared the immigration you look out for this sign that says gst and you can claim back your money immediately if you like
in whatever currency you like
or you can even charge that back to your card and they will mail back the uh refund to you when you're back in the philippines
or you can even charge that back to your card and they will mail back the uh refund to you when you're back in the philippines
yah
yah so it's very convenient
yes so i think for one day you may not have that much time uh to do your shopping but uh- so i suggest like let's say you come out from sentosa about five thirty
you can have your dinner
alright
alright
because when you're at universal studio you take the sentosa train out you're already at vivocity
because when you're at universal studio you take the sentosa train out you're already at vivocity
vivo v i v o
yah
uh it's just out of uh sentosa
uh you just take the sentosa train
and you will be out in this big shopping centre
there are lots of restaurants out there- and you can-
okay
okay
yes it's a shopping mall
yes it's a shopping mall
yes
so if you don't want to get out of this place you can also do your shopping out here
okay
uh and uh- but since your husband wants to do the tech product so i think i would suggest that you have your dinner there
and then proceed to uh funan centre
yah to get his products
or alternatively you can do this in the morning uh before you go on to sentosa island
so you can- for funan uh about ten thirty eleven
so you can go from uh funan
so you can go from uh funan
do a bit- yes
so allocate let's say about one hour-
so allocate let's say about one hour-
and then you go on to sentosa let's say at about uh in the afternoon
one o'clock twelve o'clock
one o'clock twelve o'clock
you'll be in sentosa
okay you can do your lunch again if you are doing funan you can go down to the hawker centre in the basement area
okay you can do your lunch again if you are doing funan you can go down to the hawker centre in the basement area
have your food
and then go to sentosa
and then go to sentosa
okay i hope you have an idea now how to plan
okay
yes
yes
there is a spa there as well
alright
it's outside universal
yah
alright
okay
or alternatively if your husband is doing his shopping down in funan you can always get your spa done uh at the uh nearby uh hotel area
there are some spas there as well
yah
yah alright
yes
uh i-
just the full body or just uh the legs
the feet
okay approximately about a hundred dollars
yah
yes
okay
so um- okay i think tentatively that's what i can suggest since it's like a one day programme
uh so i hope you got an idea now
okay uh in singapore we don't really practice uh giving of tips but of course if you're very happy with the service uh you're welcome to do so
but otherwise we uh don't have a compulsory tipping but if you're in the- uh if you're having your meals in the restaurants they do have a service charge there already
okay
alright
so thank you
yah

uh hm okay
uh singa~
the-
so- okay everything that i quoted here will be in the region of a thousand dollars so that means three person will be three thousand singapore dollars
is that correct
it's correct yah

yah
yes
okay because i'm opening up uh the subway map for you
okay can you see the map now

i~
it's okay now
okay
alright can you see the number three
on your right hand side
okay
that's where changi airport is
hm that's on the east
yes so you'll see a few colours right
so the green line will be the east-west line
so the green line will be the east-west line
so can you see number two on your left hand side
so that is west
yah
so i'm just giving you the green line that is from the east to the west
so i'm just giving you the green line that is from the east to the west
okay and the red line will be the north
yah
yah can you see like uh woodlands that's in the north okay

and then we have the purple line
east-west line uh sorry north-east line
and then the yellow line
that's the circle line
that's the circle line
circle
circle yeah
and uh this is our latest line
so this is the map of our subway
and of course you can always do some sight-seeing while you're taking the subway right because uh away from the centre part of the- of singapore the trains will be running above ground
yah
so you actually get to view uh you know the- some parts uh of the island uh and you know if you feel like stopping you can always stop
that's where you ha~ yes correct
alright
okay so i will close this map so you have an idea right how the subway trains run
uh let's say you are from changi and you want to go to paya lebar
can you see the junction of the yellow and green line
okay so let say you're going there
so what you do is you go to the train station and you will press paya lebar and the machine will tell you how much is the cost
so what you do is you go to the train station and you will press paya lebar and the machine will tell you how much is the cost
alright so you just put in the singapore money accordingly
alright so you just put in the singapore money accordingly

there's a money changer inside before you come out before you collect your bags there's a money changer there
there's a money changer inside before you come out before you collect your bags there's a money changer there
okay
and when you just come out from uh the transit area from the airport uh there are also money changer just immediately outside the uh uh the airport area
alright
so you change some money first in order for you to take the subway to get to your hotel alright
so try to get some smaller notes like two dollars and five dollars
lebar
okay if you are taking the um uh- if you are using because you- i think you will be spending a few days so what you can do is you can a buy a uh- you can buy this uh a tourist card
yah
yes
because uh our standard card let's say if the price is a dollar you have to put in two dollars because there is a one dollar deposit and when you leave the station you have to get back your deposit
yah because of uh the cards
yah because of uh the cards
so you must remember to get back your deposit after you exit from the uh the barrier alright
so like i said since you're spending a few days you can buy the uh the tourist card or you can buy this stored value card as well
so of course there is also uh uh a deposit that's uh given to the stored value card
yah so because we also have like uh different timing let's say uh morning off-peak hours there are certain and it's slightly cheaper
yah
so we call our subway the mrt

so in the old days where the people from all over the world when they came to singapore they like to live in this area which is near the singapore river
um and eventually it gets very crowded so people move away from this area and it became just the chinese area
people ca~ uh a lot of chinese live here because they work-
uh i would say there are minority races who live here but majority who were left here were the chinese they live here
right
so in the old days they live on the second floor or third floor ground floor was used a shop but today we used the ground floor as shops
second and third level uh we mainly used them as either a store room or uh office
so it's quite nice to walk around
yes
okay this- because in the past there were no air-condition uh so they- the architects i would say are pretty uh creative right
they make the big windows which is actually- well we learned from uh the europeans alright uh to have big windows

because- correct yah
uh so these are the china town houses
yah because uh according to the chinese the bamboos represents uh long life
yeah
so this- yah
so these are the uh peculiar uh features of the chinatown houses
and also do look out for outside the houses there are engravings like phoenixes flowers uh on the outside of the houses
but it's just above the green roof on the first level there are usually some engravings out there

yah because you have to go a few rounds
the first round is to warm up the cups uh then the first cup where you take is uh for you to smell the tea and later on you drink this tea
so you sip you don't drink the whole cup
so you sip you don't drink the whole cup
it's all very little cups you know it's like uh what the cups would look like the kind of uh toys when we are small we used to play with this little cups it looks that small

roti prata they are all made of flour
and if you again don't like spicy food then you skip the uh curry
well some of our younger children they do eat roti prata with sugar but that's not very traditional
well some of our younger children they do eat roti prata with sugar but that's not very traditional
okay
so you can also have your roti prata or your chapati with dhal

about eight dollars
about eight dollars
okay
now so you can walk around little india i gave you a few images for you to see
now so you can walk around little india i gave you a few images for you to see
and then you can go on to do kampong glam
so remember earlier on i said about the different races that used to live in singapore and later it was so crowded they all moved away to different parts of singapore
like uh milking of cows
right there's a buffalo road
okay there is- if you walk- look up a bit it's called- there's another road called kerbau road
that's also named after buffalos or cows
that's malay but- okay
so from our street names you can actually tell what kind of activities people in the past used to engage in
alright
so you walk a little bit down serangoon road you will come to this uh sri veeramakaliamman temple
yah
so from there uh in the afternoon the- in the afternoon the temple is closed but you still can get good photograph of the exterior part of the temple
take some good pictures
and then you just walk to farrer park just walk straight
again you'll come to the mrt called farrer park mrt
and then take a train to kampong glam but you have to change train
alright
so uh if you are not too tired
alright
so otherwise you can reserve kampong glam for the next day
because you'll be doing chinatown little india in the first day
so like some of the other souvenirs that you may want to pick up in little india would be like bangles
so like some of the other souvenirs that you may want to pick up in little india would be like bangles
you can buy bangles for a dollar each
for a dollar of uh a dollar for a few of these plastic bangles
sari if it's not too elaborate about singapore dollars ten dollars onwards
yah
so some shop here they get your henna painting done
yah so that's about five dollars
for one hand yah
okay
so these are the things you want to do then you proceed on either the same day or the next day you go to kampong glam
okay you try to reach the- let's say uh- it's still very busy i would say in the night time because there are lot of nice cafe out there
okay
uh no night market in kampong glam but there are a lot of cafes and of course the highlight would be the sultan mosque
okay
okay it's a mosque so uh again you have to be appropriately dressed-
for a visit to the mosque
uh but again if you want to visit the mosque you try to time your timing let's say before 4:30
alright
so you can visit the mosque but just before the prayer hall
okay so have a look it's a bit different from churches you don't see chairs inside the prayer hall
uh have a look alright
and then just outside the mosque there's a street it's a walking- a pedestrian mall called the bussorah mall
alright
some of the- again like the architecture take a look it's quite different from the little india as well as chinatown houses
no they are all traditional and conservation houses
alright so we have uh seen little india right
now proceed to kampong glam
subtle differences
okay now yes
okay now yes
you are actually seeing um a white house this used to be the sultan palace but they are now undergoing uh restoration
alright
so uh glam is actually named after a tree by the name of the glam tree
they used to grow abundantly around this area because they used to be uh just next to the sea
hm so the boats when they come here for trading they stop there
hm so the boats when they come here for trading they stop there
and these trees are pretty useful like if there's a small leak on the boat they can use uh the bark of the tree to repair the small little hole
and these trees are pretty useful like if there's a small leak on the boat they can use uh the bark of the tree to repair the small little hole
uh the leaves can be used to make medicine and the bark- the fibres of the tree can be used to make baskets
uh the leaves can be used to make medicine and the bark- the fibres of the tree can be used to make baskets
alright
yah we don't get to see a lot of this tree but they are still available
okay so i'll see- i'll show you now a map of uh kampong glam
okay but you don't need to do the whole thing
okay but you don't need to do the whole thing
it's because it's just- if you have ony one hour that's still fine
so you just walk around this certain street and i like to introduce you to- if you remember the white building that i showed you that's uh the sultan palace
okay just on outside there's a street called kandahar street
okay just on outside there's a street called kandahar street
okay
uh and this street has beautiful architecture
okay
you can pick up some traditional games and i think you have played them before possibly when you were young like five stone
uh so some of these traditional games uh you can pick them up
the- it's like about a dollar each for these kind of toys
and then you can walk to um uh haji lane
they are just one street away from each other
and you can have your dinner there
so we have like mediterranean food
uh so you can just pick whichever cafes that you like
yah
yah
so these are some interesting things that you want to do
and of course if you want to try out belly dancing as well
yah
so you can also do that in kampong glam
yah
yah you can watch their performance
yah you can watch their performance
you can join them or you can even take a short course on belly dancing
okay
so these are the things you want to do like either the whole day or you can reserve next day for uh kampong glam
okay
so i think uh that's about what you can do within one to two days right
so i think uh that's about what you can do within one to two days right
and of course don't forget a little bit of uh shopping or people watching in orchard road
because you are just staying very near
because you are just staying very near
uh just one to two station away from orchard road
okay and then of course we have the gst the seven percent uh tax rebate
if you buy above a hundred dollars from the same shop
and which has this sign that says the gst
like small little shops they will not be gst uh registered so you won't get back your tax refund
no what you do is let's say you are buying from a big shop right
no what you do is let's say you are buying from a big shop right
so uh you just tell them you want a gst form they will give it to you
you just fill it up at the airport when you're leaving singapore
just make sure that you get it stamped
uh and- when once you clear the immigration you can get back your money-
in whatever currency you want
yah the bigger shop that has this gst sign
the small little shops they will not be gst uh registered so they will not be able to uh give you the gst form
okay
okay
uh what we can do is because we don't have like fine sand in our uh- on the mainland
uh what we can do is because we don't have like fine sand in our uh- on the mainland
uh the nicer beach will be on sentosa island
uh the nicer beach will be on sentosa island
otherwise you- if you don't want we have a beach that- if you don't have to go the sentosa island then it will be on the east coast
otherwise you- if you don't want we have a beach that- if you don't have to go the sentosa island then it will be on the east coast

uh bring a picnic basket uh to the east coast
right
and it's also quite close to the airport

yes it's actually uh mooncake and together it's the lantern festival
so we will eat mooncake the children will carry lanterns

it should be somewhere in september
yah but- yah but anyway throughout this whole month you'll see a lot of shop selling this mooncake
a lot of shops will be selling the lanterns uh as well
yah

uh no usually the mooncake uh we just have mooncakes to eat and the children will carry or even the adults carry lanterns uh that's about it for the lantern festival
okay
alright
okay you know the chinese have so many different gods
so this is just a festival that is celebrated
we have a temple in- somewhere in the eastern part of singapore
yah uh so basically it's one of these gods uh uh festival that's about it
so the chinese will offer food and offering uh to the gods
food and offering
yah that's right for the particular god's birthday
uh if you are going to the temples in the eastern part of singapore then yes they are- it's quite uh festive
uh if you are going to the temples in the eastern part of singapore then yes they are- it's quite uh festive
uh otherwise it is not like a nationwide kind of uh festival
the major festival would be like chinese new year
deepavali hari raya and christmas eve
that's our major festival
chinese new year if you are down in january feb- uh january period
uh again very festival-like because we have a lot more shop selling chinese new year cookies uh decorations so it's a very kind of a festive mood
uh yah
then hari raya would be again very festive but it will be either in kampong glam or another area called geylang
then hari raya would be again very festive but it will be either in kampong glam or another area called geylang
again people are selling food associated with the celebration of hari raya
uh people are buying new clothes
uh for the whole family to wear when they visit one another
uh for the whole family to wear when they visit one another
uh deepavali quite similar to the other two festivals

yah
okay
so um september we don't really have a ma- uh sorry april we don't really have a major festival but uh good friday it's uh our pub- one of our public holidays here
summer day
so uh but otherwise it's still busy
alright we are still busy and we still have a lot of tourist coming in throughout the whole year

yah
okay bye
okay bye
okay bye
okay bye
hi good afternoon
hi uh this is uh tour guide one
uh and my name is lynnette
uh and my name is lynnette
hi lorena
hello
okay sure and uh when do you plan to come to singapore
okay just for two days
and uh would you be coming with any other people
okay
hm okay
is there-
okay
number one
does he like to see uh wildlife as well
ah okay
okay
so what i will suggest is uh the first day you could do a little bit of sightseeing and uh also include either our zoo and night safari for first day and second day sentosa
uh third day with a little bit of shopping um and relaxation
how does that sound to you
okay
uh i think it's quite fine with a thousand dollars it's actually quite fine
you can actually make do with that uh in singapore
do you have any uh hotel in mind
not at all
right
okay uh there are quite a number of places that you can stay
uh and it's quite easy to get around using the subway trains we call it the mrt out here
so that is- uh the mrt from changi is on the east it is a green line
uh you buy a standard ticket
so you just look for the place that you are uh- that the location that you will be alighting and then the price will be flashed on the screen and you just pay accordingly
so you just look for the place that you are uh- that the location that you will be alighting and then the price will be flashed on the screen and you just pay accordingly
so what i will suggest is uh change some singapore money at the airport either inside the transit hall or just outside after your collection of the bags there are money changer there
so you just change some small singapore money like uh a dollar coins two dollars notes and five dollars note to help- just to uh- for your travelling needs on the subway and to try out some local food
so you just change some small singapore money like uh a dollar coins two dollars notes and five dollars note to help- just to uh- for your travelling needs on the subway and to try out some local food
yes almost anywhere in singapore
yah
so we have like uh from changi airport is the east to the west line
so if you take all the way you come to the west that's jurong
then we have another line the red colour line that's north to the south or south to the north line
and then we have a purple line uh that goes from the uh- uh that goes from the north-east line
yes
uh no
uh can you see the map now on the uh internet
okay just give me a minute
okay just give me a minute
right okay
i think you should get it very soon in the next few seconds
and the ne~ uh-
you move to the left you see expo
you move to the left you see expo
alright
so you have to change your train from here
right
and uh- so you have to change your train at tanah merah
yah from tanah merah you follow the green line all the way down
yah from tanah merah you follow the green line all the way down
and can you see a crossing between the red and the green line
that's city hall yah
so that is actually one of the terminal station uh you can change line from here
okay
now- yah
yes
yes
and actually if you go back to tanah merah you go to the left you will see paya lebar
that is also another line that you can change it's to the yellow line or if you move up a little bit to the purple line
can you see the crisscross between yellow and green
yah and then you- yes
and then you move up you will be able to see serangoon across between yellow and purple
yes
so this are like- once you see an intersection uh with these two round circle these are uh stations that you can change line
okay
and if you are moving from changi that's to the- you're in the east
so let's say you're going to take somewhere to bugis if you move to the left
alright
uh then you just go to the direction to bugis
yah
alright
okay now can you look to the red line
can you find the red line towards the north
okay
can you find- uh there's a intercross- intersection between the red and yellow
yes
then you move up- yes you move up a little bit to ang mo kio
uh it's not in ang mo kio from there you have to change a bus to go to the zoo and night safari
okay let me- okay you are just going to the night safari park right
okay let me just show you- alright can you see now
alright you got it
it's up now uh okay
alright
the night safari park opens from seven thirty to twelve midnight
and the admission cost is thirty two dollars for an adult
yes
so basically you will be doing a tram ride
and on the tram ride you will be able to see more than seventy per cent of the- what the night safari has to offer and there are a few walking tours that you can do on the night safari park
uh you'll be riding as in in the park you mean
yes on the tram because uh the western loop of the night safari you can't walk so you will have to- i would suggest that you take uh a tram ride midway
can you see the leopard now
just now
okay
there is a stop at the uh leopard uh trail
so you could get off the leopard trail do a half an hour walk and then come back to the same tram station to board back the next tram ride and that will bring you back to the entrance
so this ride itself excluding the walk is about forty minutes
so this ride itself excluding the walk is about forty minutes
it's a slow ride and you can see the animals very up-close
for example-
yes quite close
uh no because they are wild animals
they are not like uh trained so it's just that they live in this protected park
yes
in the afternoon you could either do uh the zoo uh as well because they are all- they are just located uh next door to one another and you are looking at different animals
yes they are just next door to one another so it's totally different
so you are seeing- in the zoo you'll be seeing more mammals uh like the orang-utan the chimpanzee
uh for the night safari it will be more of the nocturnal creatures like the uh uh tigers the leopards uh basically animals that hunt in the night time
yah
so this is something that you may want to consider
uh otherwise on the first day uh you could also do a little bit of uh sightseeing around singapore uh going to the ethnic areas of singapore
uh you could also do a little bit of the kampong glam and little india in the morning the whole day alright
are accessible on the mrt except that you may have to just to change trains but like i mentioned it's fairly easy to get around
yah we do have quite a lot of the uh bars
yah we do have quite a lot of the uh bars
uh so maybe the first day you could do that and uh if let's say after your uh night safari and you're not too tired you can bring your husband yourself relax uh- i would like to recommend you the clarke quay area or boat quay area that's in the southern part of singapore
okay
basically there are a lot of bars there so you could have a drink
uh and of course i'd like to recommend you- um specially concocted in singapore it's called the singapore gin sling
uh that is something uh one of our signature drink that you can get in any of the bars
uh but of course if you like something very traditional
then it will be at the raffles hotel the long bar over at the raffles hotel
that's also on the southern part of singapore
best drink
uh i would say other drinks other than liquor some traditional drinks uh bubble tea where we can get from small bubble tea shops
uh the indian drink will be lassi uh the malay drinks would teh tarik
okay norm~
normally it's a tinge of sweetness
so it's tea uh mixed with a lot of different kind of uh fruits but it is not um- it doesn't- it's not as thick as a smoothie
uh yah
so these are the other drinks that we have uh other than cocktail drinks or wine
yes
so you can get this bubble tea from a lot of counters uh and they are usually counters located in shopping uh complex
so you can get this bubble tea from a lot of counters uh and they are usually counters located in shopping uh complex
uh you would be able to find one such store otherwise in some of our food centres you maybe a to~
i guess we do have a lot of convenient stores
um the local chain would be like cheers c h e e r s it's a small convenient store
okay otherwise uh every other uh let's say front of some shopping centres you will also find little cafés
uh are you talking about like to get snacks and drink
okay
so yes one of the local ones would be like cheers um and then we have like supermarket there is always one in uh the major shopping centres there is always a supermarket

uh these are the kind of uh i would say supermarket and you can always find one uh of this supermarket in uh the shopping centres
so you can always get your drinks your snacks basically do even marketing
uh major shopping centres located at the orchard belt area
so again if you remember correctly if you take the green line to the left and then to city hall there's a big shopping centre there called raffles city
beneath the road there is citylink
and if you take another few stops away uh that's to orchard road mrt train station
uh on that same stretch of road there are lots and lots of shopping centre
well i would say that singapore is one city but it is a place where a lot of the locals the tourists go there for people watching uh do a bit of shopping as well as have tea dinners lunch
well i would say that singapore is one city but it is a place where a lot of the locals the tourists go there for people watching uh do a bit of shopping as well as have tea dinners lunch
it's a place where you can do a lot of things out there
right
ah okay
it's um- actually this street name is actually named after the street before we developed into orchard road used to be a plantation orchard plantation that's how this street gets its name
uh so like some of the major shopping centre would be um tangs studio tangs uh ngee ann city which is a huge shopping complex
ion it's uh one of the latest addition uh nice shopping centre
uh just all across one another and next to one another
okay then if you go further down the street you have paragon uh plaza singapura um the centrepoint okay uh one three one and we also have uh h&m now in singapore
right
okay
let me- yes okay
alright
okay uh i'm actually giving you the map now
okay can you see uh this shopping centre on top is called ion
okay this is- yah
then you can see some of the street scene okay
and i will also give you the map now
yah
so- okay this is one whole- okay can you see this yellow box thing somewhere around number ten

okay this whole street
so you see all the blue buildings they are all uh hotels or shopping complexes
yah
so these are all shopping
so all the blue buildings are either shops or- i mean shopping mall or hotels

ten am and finish at nine thirty
well you have the- yah
alright
uh we have of course the luxury brands uh gucci coach prada
they are located in most of these shopping centres like number thirty twenty two ion we have them

they are found in uh number twenty two that's ion
uh number twenty six okay
uh and also twenty three alright
uh and also twenty three alright
they are found in these shopping mall so this is um home uh home grown so i don't think you have this brand in uh philippines

uh the city hall right now is uh not used as a city hall anymore we are uh refurbishing it
so we're renovating it and it's going to become one of our art gallery

and we move on to the second world war period from nineteen forty three to nineteen forty five and to present day alright
and independence how we struggle through uh to- in order to find- to build homes for the people living here jobs to modern day
yes correct

so when you are going to chinatown so you can pay a visit there okay then you learn ab~ uh sorry
uh the history of singapore you will learn from the national history of singapore-

so-
the library is a green building

but we have a lot of other uh community libraries all found within the various estate in singapore
uh we have uh sungei buloh which is on the northwest of singapore
uh we have uh sungei buloh which is on the northwest of singapore

and we do have a free wireless uh trail
okay you can just uh sort of uh borrow the uh uh uh webcam
okay
and another uh other walks that you can do you climb uh bukit timah hill as well
well uh bukit timah is not a mountain it's a hill
we don't have mountains in singapore unfortunately
our tallest hill is bukit timah but it has a lot of uh flora and fauna
uh it's three hundred and eighty six uh metres tall
how many floor
a bit high
oh but you are not going to climb steps it's like uh a slope going up the hill and uh well you can do it within- you can climb from the bottom to the top of hill
it is not uh a too fast running up just walking a brisk walk you should be able to arrive in one hour
uh no you have to climb up
yah
but you see a lot of interesting plants uh when you are up on the- uh along the way up to the hill
okay you've seen that
the visitor centre
okay i'll come back to the hotel
okay now let-
yes
if you like to stay in orchard road uh since this is a birthday celebration uh-
there are lots of- yah there are lot of hotels on orchard road so it all depends on your uh price uh category
and you move on we have grand park hotel
so again i'm coming back to the stretch of orchard road uh
okay so uh these are all the various hotel that is located on uh uh orchard road
and then if-
yah
uh they do have uh you can have a one night stay uh in the various hotel so normal check-in like two to three o'clock in the afternoon uh and the next day the check out time uh is around twelve o'clock uh the next day
alright
okay there are quite a number of hotels uh what you mentioned
uh there is like uh fullerton bay hotel it's like a five-star luxury hotel
it used to be uh the first uh central post office in singapore but it's now converted to uh fullerton hotel
so that's one it's a five-star luxury
uh we have at city hall mrt fairmont hotel
on sentosa itself since i think you may also visit sentosa you could stay at the capella
but these are- like i mentioned these are uh five-star luxury hotels
okay or you could also stay at the marina bay sands
uh this is like uh landmark building
uh it faces the marina bay so you get a good uh view and of course remember to ask for the bay view side of the hotel okay
uh and around the bay you have other hotels like um the pan pacific the mandarin oriental these are all uh nice hotel
yes and also uh the budget uh that you would like to spend because uh they range uh from- in the region of about singapore dollars one night stay about four hundred plus
yes they are five-star hotel
if you are talking about uh let's say uh a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars
okay we have some of these hotel
there is one in the orchard belt it's called the hotel supreme it's near to the plaza singapura
there is one in the orchard belt it's called the hotel supreme it's near to the plaza singapura
okay
east village
yah it's a little bit far off
uh okay maybe i can also recommend you this hotel called uh link hotel
it's in-
link l i n k
link hotel
uh it is located in the residential area called tiong bahru and you are about uh just one mrt away from chinatown
alright
or uh- that's a three-star hotel we move down it's oxford hotel
it's also a good location uh but they don't have facilities like the spa
okay but you can stay there as well for one night then you do your museums your ethnic area and then the next day you move to a nice hotel
yah
what you- okay
sentosa there are lots of things there is the beach alright
then you can go to the universal theme park
you can go by uh cable car to sentosa form uh either mount faber or harbourfront
can you see the map now of sentosa
okay
a broad wall
okay can you see that
okay
so it's linked to the mainland it's an island off the southern part of singapore
so it is one big playground
it's one big playground alright
now-
uh we have what we call the luge
it's a little bit similar uh you can ride on this vehicle
uh but there is uh fixed routing that you have to do
right
yes so you-
uh i wouldn't say it's like a bicycle you don't ride you know
you basically press on like uh accelerator
a little bit like uh those bumper cars but it's not built like a bumper car it is more open
let me see
yah um-
yah
so let's say if you want to do uh the two- uh the luge alright uh that's eighteen dollars
two luge that means two ride
uh now can you see this people doing a luge
yah
so it's a little bit like bumper car but it's not so covered right
so it's quite great fun uh doing the luge
the prices for just one luge and one skyride will be twelve dollars and fifty cents per person
yah
so this is the extra uh prices that you will have to pay
and then you can go over and do the uh resort world like uh the universal studio
yes
okay
okay
anyway thank you for calling uh me alright and i hope i have been helpful alright
anyway thank you for calling uh me alright and i hope i have been helpful alright
okay you have a good day then
okay bye
bye
bye
hi good afternoon
lynnette here
uh so i hope you're feeling great as well
okay
yes
right
alright
okay and you are coming with uh- how many people are you coming with
right
and your nephew is below twelve
so um well first of all we would have- over here in singapore we speak- a lot of us speak english
so you don't really have a problem with communications
now when you arrive in the changi airport do get some singapore money first
exchange some money first with our money changer booth
there are money changers there
there are money changers there
yah
yes it's not really the raining season
yes nice warm weather
and uh- well even if it rains is not a big issue because you could always spend some time in the mall have a cup of coffee
by the time you finish your drinks the rain would have stopped
yah
okay
so once you board the mrt you just uh look for the uh machine the ticket machine and they would tell you how much money to put in
uh just take note there is a deposit of one dollar
so when you exit from your destination remember to take back your uh one dollar deposit
uh sorry i didn't get you
uh you will receive a card that looks like a credit card that size
t a n a h
yah
okay there are quite of few options
again it depends on uh which particular area that you like to stay in
uh there are some uh hotels which are fairly inexpensive uh along orchard road
which is on our main shopping area
if you look at the green line uh that's- it's somewhere if you look at number five which is on the south
right
uh you move up a little bit between four and five uh there is this area called tiong bahru
yah
so there's a hotel there as well called link hotel
otherwise if you again follow the green line you will come to uh bugis there's also hotel there
and if you move up a little bit that's lavender
okay you go down a little bit to the yellow line bras basah uh there is also a hotel out there
and you move up the red line to orchard road orchard- can you see orchard
uh there is two other hotels there york hotel elizabeth hotel
uh they are i would say um reasonable rates and yet you are very uh right in the heart of the city
okay uh per night uh in the range of uh a hundred and sixty dollars right up to two hundred dollars per room
yah
yes you could
yes and you probably would require an extra bed for your nephew
huh
uh so this is the hotel area that you are talking about
of course you like to uh spend a little bit more then again there are other hotels that you may want to consider along orchard road
of course like international hotels we have hyatt hotel
uh down to grand park hotel
it's near to the somerset mrt
in between somerset and uh orchard road
in between somerset and uh orchard road
yes
uh yes
unless you planning to change hotel every night
so you take the mrt for sightseeing uh i'm showing this uh mrt map for you get a feel of the different uh lines that we have
and just to show you the hotel location for the various uh hotels that i'm recommending
yah so there are very conveniently located because they are very near to the mrt and- it's- the mrt is actually a very inexpensive way of travelling in singapore
yes
right
right
right
right
okay we have a over in- near the somerset mrt there are a few shopping centre
okay we have a over in- near the somerset mrt there are a few shopping centre
right
so our shopping hours starts from ten am to nine thirty every day
yah
okay
so this is the shopping area
so there's always a lot of uh things to do out here
if you are tired just go in to any of the cafés um have a smoothie or cold drink coffee tea alright
and carry on shopping
alright
or your friend uh yah
you could do a little bit of uh sightseeing
so let say you are staying somewhere on orchard road alright
the hotel that i was talking about
uh in the range of two hundred dollars you could take the subway and you alight at city hall
uh in the range of two hundred dollars you could take the subway and you alight at city hall
you look down the red line city hall
okay
yap
okay and it's a nice area
you just walk along the bay uh the bay area
yes
okay can you see now
okay five minutes to the padang area it's a shady spot
you can walk and then you will come to the merlion
so i would say about ten minutes
yah
so you can take nice picture out there because the merlion is a symbol of singapore
yah
and from there you can go- opposite is a uh nice building
you can take a picture of this uh building out there and that is the fullerton hotel
yah
so you can continue on your journey because the merlion is located in the financial district of singapore
uh you will just use the underpass to go across to the opposite side of the merlion and you will board your train at the raffles place mrt
and from there you take the west line
okay just give a minute
okay now i'm showing you the map of uh what i'm talking about
top-right uh yah
that is the merlion
uh so you walk underneath the- uh underpass
can you see the underpass
okay that is the raffles place mrt
uh just at this corner here there is actually a shop there
so if you want to pick up some uh souvenirs like the merlion keychain and all that
and you will go down to the cha~ uh tanjong pagar
yah
hm but it is a little bit different from what we have here
uh and you may want to visit the oldest chinese temple in singapore
they call the thian hock keng temple
uh and try to put on like shirt or t-shirts with sleeves
yes
so i'm gonna show you the image of uh thian hock keng temple there
so right
it says that uh right now we are doing some restoration work to the temple but it's one of our oldest chinese- is our oldest chinese temple
yes you ar~ yes you are allowed to take pictures outside the chinese temple
in fact the most beautiful part of the temple would be the roof where you see a lot of dragons right
the dragons out there
the roof it looks like bamboo because according to the chinese the bamboos are a symbol of long life
it's built like- it looks like a bamboo that's all
yes
so uh you could still do uh- you could still go inside although the temple is undergoing restoration
uh just a feel uh and a god uh in this particular temple is dedicated to the goddess of the sea call ma zhu po
and when you leave the temple this picture shows you the main entrance of the temple you turn to your right-hand side okay you walk about uh four hundred metres and you will come to a hawker centre
hawker
uh yes
h a w k e r it is a non-air-conditioned food centre
okay
you can have a lunch
yah you can have your lunch there
okay so-
uh it's not a restaurant
it's all little shop which is about uh a hundred metre kind of a shop hundred square metre
uh and they sell a lot of different kind of food
huh
yes it's a variety uh ranging from chinese food to uh malay and you can eat to indian and you can even get some western meals there as well
alright
so uh some of the local dishes you may want to try it out would be um carrot cake
okay
so-
it's not the-
it's not what you think the carrot looks like
uh this is our version of carrot cake
uh it's actually white radish
uh it's actually white radish
it's radish fried with uh flour and egg
it's radish fried with uh flour and egg
and sometimes it looks a bit dark because they have been cook with a uh dark sauce
and sometimes it looks a bit dark because they have been cook with a uh dark sauce
dark soya sauce
dark soya sauce
okay now can you see the word- the highlighted area
so you see the red um- thian hock keng temple if you look at ayer- telok ayer street
right
you are here remember i said when you leave the temple you turn right
so it's about a four hundred metres walk
okay and you actually pass by the al-abrar mosque
the highlighted area again that's um a mosque
uh it's a place of worship for the muslim
you stand outside you could actually look inside
so and then you just turn to the left again you come to the amoy street food centre
yah so just look around the food centre
they are always uh photos of the food that each of this vendor uh sell
yah and again do carry a bit of singapore money with you
'cause they are like a few dollars each
like uh carrot cake would probably cost about uh two fifty two dollars fifty cents to three dollars for one plate
uh as-
yah
so it's actually- yes it's quite different from the uh kind of a baked carrot cake that we often yah
so this is the chinese version
right
and uh of course there are lots of other delicious food
okay
so that would cost you a meal there would cost you three dollars for a main dish and a drink will be in the region of a cold drink in a region of a dollar forty cents
yah
so that's taken care of
and then you just walk
can you see amoy street
okay there is a pathway uh a kind of steps where you climb up
it's about two-story tall
and then you arrive at ann siang hill
ann siang hill in green can you see that
alright
so uh these are very nice houses out here
um interesting i would say because some of the houses here has two doors
the outer door which is smaller like a cowboy door
yah and then they have a bigger door
so these are own traditionally by the peranakan chinese
that means the strait born chinese
yah so bit- it's a nice row of houses here
okay
and you walk down-
ann siang road again
and you come to south bridge road
right
okay
and you walk against the traffic
and you cross
from here you can see sri mariamman temple
yah so this is an indian temple
so we are doing your tour in the morning
uh the sri mariamman temple will be open 'til twelve o'clock in the afternoon
but there will not be so much activities going on in the afternoon
they wouldn't- before twelve o'clock
yes so you can do that
uh take a look and you have to remove your shoes before you go into the indian temple
just put your shoes uh in the shoe racks
yah and do a short walk in the temple
and when you're out you turn left to pagoda street
yah
and you also mention you like to pick up some souvenirs
yah so there are some chinese souvenirs that you may want to pick up
okay
uh right
so you can just walk around
and there are some coffee shops coffee shops meaning uh non-air-conditioned drinking places and food place~
and there are some coffee shops coffee shops meaning uh non-air-conditioned drinking places and food place~
right
so anytime you are hungry or thirsty you can always pick up some food or drinks along the-
yah
yes
so you follow this road again down to trengganu street
and you make a left turn
okay
you come to sago street
right
so there are all sorts of chinese pastry there
okay
alright
so uh and if you again want to visit another chinese temple there is another chinese temple uh called the buddha relic temple
it's just in-between sago street and sago lane
it's just in-between sago street and sago lane
uh i would recommend the morning or afternoon zoo for you
because you were walking from the merlion right up to the chinatown
and i guess with all this walk you would be a little bit tired
so in the night time you may just want to uh rest up for- uh rest for a little while before you head out for dinner
okay
uh we will come back to the dinner places later on
let's go to the zoo
okay the zoo is located in the uh north part of singapore
otherwise you can take the subway the mrt to ang mo kio
and from there you board a bus to the zoo
this is the morning and afternoon zoo
uh and dinner out in the zoo or night safari park
there are food and beverages and fast food available in both the um zoo and the night safari park
right
so uh in the day zoo this will be more uh mammals that you see in the day zoo
and then you board back the tram
and then you board back the tram
alright same thing with the night safari
the night safari you were going to see different animals
ninety per cent will be nocturnal creatures uh like the leopards the tigers which are nocturnal creatures
no our zoo- both our zoo and night safari so they are called open zoo
so you won't see cages
yah but not to worry
they do not come out of their so-called enclosure
hm so it's really-
yah
it's beautiful it's like park you know
is- i'm showing you now uh just portion of the day zoo
okay this is our night safari park
yes so you can see the first picture
these are wild malayan tapir
uh and these animals are wild creatures so do not stretch out any part of your body
alright and do not touch the animals they are wild animals
the leopards uh they are separated from you by the glass enclosure
uh no feeding because they are wild animals
and the zoo and the night safari have a standard uh feeding time for the animals
so we don't want them to get overweight right
okay
so this is uh- it will be very interesting
come back and take the next tram and you are back at the entrance
so on the tram ride it's about forty minutes excluding the walk
so on the tram ride it's about forty minutes excluding the walk
so this is the uh night safari
okay
there are like shows if your nephew is interested we have the creatures of the night show
there are like shows if your nephew is interested we have the creatures of the night show
this- yah
so what the safari do is they bring up some of the animals the smaller animals and uh- it's just a- it's a simple show uh to show you how basically animals behave
that's about it
alright we don't dress them up because they are still wild animals
and the show time is seven thirty eight thirty and nine thirty pm uh if the weather permits
alright
of course if you can spend three hours that would be better
of course if you can spend three hours that would be better
so if you don't want to walk then forty minutes on the uh tram ride
but i definitely recommend you to do at least one walking trail at the leopards trail
so i will show you the walking trails because on the tram ride you see seventy per cent of the animals
the balance of thirty per cent you will have to walk
so we divide the park into the various sector like himalayan foothills the nepalese river valley
okay
equitoria~
yah
yah for each of the sector
so you will have uh areas that stimulate the natural habitat of these different animals that are found in these areas
yah so this is the night safari park
right
yah it's a very popular tourist spot for both the locals and the tourists
right
so- and i guess your nephew may also be interested to do the jurong bird park as well
okay
right
alright
and i think you should not miss the lorry loft
okay
and you can feed them
okay but you cannot feed them with human food
so we feed them with the honey water and that's available in the lorry loft itself
huh
so and the birds the lorries will come and perch on your hand to feed
because when you're holding this bowl of honey water all the birds will come
so it makes a very good pictures alright for your family
yah and there are so colourful
yah
so these are the ones
and of course also do not miss the show
yes
uh night safari or show
uh both the night safari and the jurong bird park
the zoo
okay
okay
for the adult it's fifty eight dollars
uh the child is thirty eight dollars for the three parks
jurong bird park
so what you can do is you do the jurong bird park in the morning there's a zoo in the afternoon and the night safari in the night time
yah and that's like a full day programme already
so the night before get a good rest
'cause you're doing three parks in one day
okay

hm and the things are deep fried
the next picture again quite commonly seen in little india these are flower garland shop
uh the white flowers that you see will be jasmine flower
yah

you see a very elaborate structure
okay
this is the main entrance of a hindu temple
alright
okay again more street scenes in little india
so some of the local food will be like vadi
vadi looks a little bit like a doughnut
and you can eat it
normally the store owner will give you a green chili as well
so you take a bite on the green chili and a bite of this vadi
so it's something very local
uh if you don't want to eat the chili then you just eat the doughnut
yah uh it's like- it's called vadi
yah
so that gives you a little bit of an idea of what uh little india has
and you may want to do a temporary tattoo which we call it henna painting
that will cost you about five dollars
okay some uh souvenirs in case you want to buy will be like brassware
boxes the jewellery boxes uh jewellery boxes made of wood

uh where are you intending to stay uh
uh where are you intending to stay uh uh what sort of uh
what do you think
okay what you have here- are you getting it on the screen now
so do you see the green line at the bottom right-hand side
that is the changi airport
and if you follow the line uh from the right to the left
you are entering into town
and that is where we have maybe the better class hotels
if you follow uh a little bit further out
you know where the green line hits the yellow and the red
yes
you follow the green line uh up left towards the north
you'll get orchard
do you see orchard
orchard is a very popular road
and that is-
you can get off there
there are lots of uh shops there
night clubs
if you go the other way when you take the train and you go down to- you switch to clarke quay you could actually walk
uh that's near one of our rivers called the singapore river
and you might want to bar hop there at night
oh that will go a long way
yes
because uh you are-
you are not looking for luxurious hotels
uh are you also um- do you mind if the place is a little bit crammed and uh you know not so large but uh in a-
yes that's right
uh you know those uh what we call ethnic heritage areas
so you step out you can get chinese food or indian food
okay
small shops
okay i'm gonna get you hotels in chinatown
just
yes you would save a lot of money shopping
uh we have a good range in singapore
you could spend it in one day
you could spend it in a week
yes
if your hotel is not too uh expensive
okay
let's see huh
just- okay are you getting the screen now
so-
affordable prices yes
this is chinatown-
which i think is quite interesting
which i think is quite interesting
but chinatown is uh you know you can walk out and buy things from the shops
you can also walk to the nearest uh train station
and get down to orchard road
okay
okay
i'm not saying anything
i just thought that uh so have more money shopping
yah
yes
let's say- well that's just- these are all um clean hotels
you know they are usually
you see it has only twenty five rooms
it's a boutique hotel actually do you see the hotel description
i got my arrow there
so what they've done is they converted all shop houses into hotel rooms so the hotel rooms are not uh very wide
so what they've done is they converted all shop houses into hotel rooms so the hotel rooms are not uh very wide
perhaps uh you can get off uh your hotel room in about fifteen minutes-
and uh you know you could- but the shops open a bit later
maybe about ten o'clock
uh depends-
uh depends-
mall- oh yes you could walk down to central mall which is-
by the singapore river
by the singapore river
there's also um coffee joints
yah ninety dollars only right
yah ninety dollars only right
yes
yes and you could hang out at the bars
uh not far
uh you can uh just walk to the nearest train station-
which is tanjong pagar
which is tanjong pagar
westwards
and uh you get off at harbourfront
and there you can take a shuttle into sentosa
i don't have the exact fare it goes by distance
i don't have the exact fare it goes by distance
but what i advise is you get a card when you come in
at changi airport you go to the mrt station and you collect- you pay in advance for a card with stored value
and then before you go back you'll get your change if you hand it back in
unless you want it as a souvenir
if you are taking the trains and the buses-
i think just maybe twenty dollars or even less
it's a- it's because of the deposit you have to pay but you're getting it back once you hand in the card
it's for the manufacture of the card
so if you are not intending to bring it back you know uh it's- it's just the distance travelled and i think you will spend- on travel maybe only ten dollars or so
so if you are not intending to bring it back you know uh it's- it's just the distance travelled and i think you will spend- on travel maybe only ten dollars or so
unless you're travelling all the time and you're not-
heading off and shopping or eating you know
oh
no
no you don't need so much if you are using buses than train
yah
the only thing is if you take the train ride round singapore um you have- and you get off say one stop from your hotel
uh you will have to pay a two dollar surcharge
that's all
uh restaurants or bars
do you take- oh yes
great authentic food
let me see
yes
we have a very old market that has been spruced up and it's one of my favourite places to eat
we have also muslim food there and indian food but people go there for chinese food
uh let me try and see which there
if you add a lot of food ten dollars will go a long way
that's a lot
assuming you have a big appetite
uh let me see if i can get this uh- take a look
uh maxwell market
food centre let's see can you see maxwell food centre there
okay
oops
and it would be within walking distance-
from your hotel
and really you- even if you stay somewhere else this is a good place to try uh local food
and there are some open at dinner time and supper time
and we've got noodles we've got rice
there are also-
uh vegetarian stalls and uh fish soups if you are thinking of something healthy
uh you- do you have dietary needs
do you-
any of you-
oh so that's good
besides going to the market there would be stalls just outside your hotel
uh actually i should tell you that uh your hotel is located in what uh maybe eighty years ago was a red light district-
but it's full stop now
so around that area there are many uh food stalls uh and uh coffee shops we call them actually
uh you want to go to uh you was- you mentioned the beach earlier right
so i'm gonna get sentosa for you
okay let me get back the- okay now
you see where you are you could walk to the uh mrt station
you see where you are you could walk to the uh mrt station
and uh you could- are you getting sentosa on your screen
so where you are is- let me see- tanjong pagar
about maybe two- just a minute uh let me get on the train
uh can you see tanjong pagar
are you getting it
you go on the green line-
and you go to outram park
and then you switch to the north east line
the purple line
you just go one stop and you're at harbourfront
and then you can just ask anybody for directions
the bus bay where sentosa operates shuttle buses into sentosa on a regular basis
uh or you could take an express then you have to go- that in fact there's a huge shopping area there
uh or you could take an express then you have to go- that in fact there's a huge shopping area there
there are two shopping malls there vivocity and harbourfront
harbourfront is the older one
at vivocity on the top floor you can get an express light rail system direct into sentosa
malay- this time you get more of the malay uh that means uh muslim food and indian food
there's also lot of chinese stalls food stalls
uh the people who work at harbourfront at the malls they often go across the road to where the bus terminal is to get their food
so it's nice to check it out you know check it out first
and if you still want to take the express train you could
you could cross the road and you make your way to vivocity and you can take the train in
otherwise you can take the shuttle
i think it cost about a dollar only extra on you
i think it cost about a dollar only extra on you

if you take the cable car-
you end up there on the island
imbiah lookout is the- is the stop
and it's on a little hill
and it's on a little hill
from there you can walk to the butterfly park
uh you could uh take a little ride you know on this little- like sling down the little hill but this is a concrete trail
so when you're there you can check out all the places there
there are- you could walk to the beach from there too
and there's a museum in what used to be uh former british military hospital converted to museum
i suggest you visit that
um it's called images of singapore
let me see if it's shown here
it's- uh the history of singapore
and-
now on beaches you'll see what you see now
do you see the dolphins
yah and now do you see universal world
if you like to go to universal studios you could visit that
that would-
cost a bit more money
maybe i say about fifty dollars or hundred dollars
can i get universal studios for you to get it more accurately/
can i get universal studios for you to get it more accurately/
because there are rides that you can take there
but two days is a little short
i think you need uh five days
okay
okay
universal studios huh
so if you stay there you would use up your thousand dollars very quickly
no i mean the hotel there would be you know more than a hundred dollars
so we have these rides
are you into rides
i mean um-
but-
yah
so yes that would save you a lot of money
uh you have to get out of sentosa island first
and then uh you have to take public transport
okay
so marina bay you're lucky because the train has just uh connected to marina bay
so you connect with the blue line
you could either continue to dhoby ghaut and then switch to the red line
and uh that is also fun
because dhoby ghaut is a major interchange and there are lot- there's a huge shopping mall there
so you might want to spend some time there before you change to the red line
and go south to marina bay
the red line is the newest line
i don't have the date with me but uh we can check out that
then stop here
we have major theatres there
uh esplanade theatres on the bay
uh theatre and a concert hall
and we have shows there
alright
uh we have lunch time concerts but that would be like once a month so-
it may not coincide with the time you are coming but let me see
yah
okay let me see
yah
yes okay
okay
no events
i'm sorry
yah
uh they are built like the old style microphones that have the um the rounded tops so it's like two big caps uh on the water let me see
here you go
have you got it
uh good quality shops uh
uh what did you say
your date was uh weekend
is it a weekday
april sixteenth
april sixteen let me check
ah you coming on a monday
no sixteenth is a monday and-
no sixteenth is a monday and-
yah
no that is a- i'm not sure what they have uh on those dates right now
uh okay
just a minute
that mean-
uh weekend is more um fun
it is more full of activities
and when we are celebrating certain festivals like chinese new year or the christmas there are lots of free performances just in the concourse area
uh let me see uh
yah i'm trying to find it on their own website
okay
okay
march
you-
so you have an idea of what we have
and maybe on the first of january you try it when you- uh first of april i mean
uh it's usually school holiday time for the countries nearby and-
uh singaporeans also travel so- uh rather move around singapore's attractions
so that was one week of busy time at the shopping malls and the-
attractions
uh april i think they've all gone back to school
so uh it would not be so crowded it would be quite relaxed
especially on a monday and tuesday i think uh
i find it a little bit too crowded down at orchard road on the weekends
because everybody likes to go there
okay
uh are you getting the schedule now for april
sixteenth
oh sorry
okay
we got a music concerto
what uh- oh this is interesting
did you see this
south mother africa
uh no fifteenth
okay let me check
oh wednes-
monday
they take a break on monday
they take a break on monday
yah unless you're into dance and dance workshops on the seventeenth
yah unless you're into dance and dance workshops on the seventeenth
that's what we have
okay so three hour workshop
and it's only fourteen dollars
and the person conducting i think
you can stay as long as you like but i don't think uh sentosa would like you to sleep on the beach
that's all
so when we have a beach party they tell people that you know in the mornings we have the shuttle buses to go out
so when we have a beach party they tell people that you know in the mornings we have the shuttle buses to go out
uh actually i don't know about that you know
but maybe the lifeguards will come around
there are more worried about safety
oh you could stay later than that because we have beach bars
um but you know being sentosa the prices will not be the same as um let's say chinatown
uh hm let me see-
if i can get the beach
sentosa beach bars
okay
ah usually it's on weekends we have-
here you are
okay
see
pardon
uh one of our outer islands to do snorkelling uh there's not much underwater wildlife on that beach
i mean it's merely for swimming
uh snorkelling
let me see uh you would need to go with uh somebody who organises it i would suggest
and i also think you should stay longer because otherwise- it's one whole day
uh no i'm afraid the organisers in singapore organise for outside singapore
there is one place uh at sisters island but the waters there are quite rough
and i'm not sure because i don't snorkel myself uh or rather i- uh frankly i don't snorkel in singapore
no because over there it's too rough for me huh
no because over there it's too rough for me huh
i don't swim
so i have to go to places where the fish come up to your feet you know uh in very little water
so-
snorkelling
you need to hire a boat and uh wait uh
let me try to see if they have it somewhere else here
'cause i don't want to give you- wait sorry
lap- you know if you are buying laptops or you are buying something expensive then you know your thousand dollars will not uh accommodate that
it's a pity
i have a niece who go snorkelling
and she would yes singapore
okay
uh here there
do you see this
uh and i have friends who go uh surveying
okay
so the waters frankly in singapore are not so clear
the variety i'm told is good for singapore waters
yes uh i have to be frank with you um
you can use singapore as a base to maybe indonesia or malaysia and try snorkelling there
if you are you know very keen on seeing- if you like- you need to see the fish right in your eye
colourful corals ah
it's a it mall
okay
yah
okay
usually what i advise people to do is to- okay you have a picture of the mall there
go to the various shops and ask for the price of the item you want to buy and tell them frankly that you are price checking so they will give you the best price
hm you said you are good at walking right
you could walk there
or you could take-
no i think maybe forty minutes or thirty minutes
three twenty upwards uh and it's a- we have some surcharges if you leave early in the morning like when everyone is going to office
those are the peak hours
and in the evenings
but because we have the buses running also full steam and the trains they agreed- if you miss the train this morning it was two minutes before the next train came
so i think it's really- it's also more fun for you you know
you'll get to see the local people
how we move around
um and where you are
um and where you are
like you- i have told you it's so well connected
you have lots of buses lots of trains
you have lots of buses lots of trains
the taxis uh in chinatown you have to go to a taxi stop uh to pick the taxi
yes uh it's as safe in both
you just don't take all your bling and hang it all around you
uh i don't think you'll be doing that right
uh i don't think you'll be doing that right
uh just take the usual precautions
but if you are sort of walking around chinatown you need to find a cab station you know a taxi stand to get your cab
they are not allowed to stop any and everywhere
chinatown would be the best place
uh there are street stalls and there are also shops
but like i said you might want to walk around the whole place first
but like i said you might want to walk around the whole place first
and find out
but usually in chinatown they are more or less the same price for the cheap souvenirs like three items for ten dollars
but usually in chinatown they are more or less the same price for the cheap souvenirs like three items for ten dollars
and there would be different sort of items
but you can come to singapore and use the services of the companies that organise for singaporeans to go snorkelling nearby
you know and it would not be expensive you know
you know and it would not be expensive you know
uh say again
sorry
uh huh
okay
you can chew gum in singapore you just cannot import gum
that's the miscon- you can bring in gum but if you brought in a whole carton uh the customs would- will take it away from you because they will assume you are selling it
uh the only thing is when you dispose of your gum you have to make sure it's wrapped up and thrown in a bin
uh the only thing is when you dispose of your gum you have to make sure it's wrapped up and thrown in a bin
or some people carry a little plastic bag and put it in the handbag until they find a proper dustbin to throw it
uh you also- some tourist carry a little- do you smoke
so you know they have a little gadget for holding your ashes when you are smoking
so you know they have a little gadget for holding your ashes when you are smoking
uh i've seen a tourist used it
i thought it was very cute
you- so that you can smoke uh at designated areas but if there's no bin to dispose of your cigarette after you smoke you just keep it back in the container
it's just so that you don't break the anti-littering law
although most of the time nobody gets caught
so uh singapore may not be as clean as you imagine it to be
uh the restaurants also uh they have a restriction on the place where you can uh eat and smoke
so it's usually outdoors
so it will be clearly marked out
so you have to seat in that area which means if there are only 3 tables and they are taken then you have to go to a non-smoking area and you cannot smoke there
bring extra money for shopping is it
uh there- you still have some time with me so if you want to ask anything else
let me go down
uh clarke quay
okay you mentioned uh- okay
not spelt it correctly
so i'm going to clarke quay
oh clarke quay bar
no this one is for-
uh actually on a weekday
i'm not sure if it's tuesday or wednesday
some bars have a women's night
where you get it free
the only thing is you have to dress like a woman
they have uh refused to let some women in who were dressed uh not like women if you get what i mean
they have uh refused to let some women in who were dressed uh not like women if you get what i mean
uh and uh senior citizens
so uh-
he-
yes the ladies get in for free
usually the cover charge is maybe twenty dollars or-
a weekday is lower than uh weekends
maybe just fifteen dollars
uh see- can you see here
uh let me try and get it here
there you go
and lunch- a lunch at clarke quay unless they have changed it it's only about fifteen plus
uh at clarke quay
i've done a walk there myself and uh i was very tempted to go in and eat
so tuesday is drivers' night huh
i don't know how you- oh you got to be a certified then
do you see this
so if you have your driver's license
if- you know
free flow house pour jug
the whole jug at thirty dollars
usually it's the wednesday night that's on- wednesdays and thursdays
hm and i suggest you stay a little bit longer because it will allow you to see more things
you- you may- yes for your shopping and uh you might have extra money to go home
or you could you know fill up with your shopping
um it's hot and sometimes wet throughout the year
so yes my advice is to bring a cardigan more for the you know if you go in the bars sometimes they're cold or the restaurants
or the air conditioning within uh certain areas
uh let me see here
okay
although uh these few months we had some cold evenings which is very nice if you enjoy walking out in the open
so in the evening times many people go out and walk because they find it- well firstly if they work in day they have time only in the evenings
yes so here you see a scene of the light up
can you see it works
uh you come to see the light up
but at the time you come you can- we are now linking up the shops in orchard road so um it's not hundred per cent connected but like maybe eighty per cent
you can walk from mall to mall without getting wet
and as you say you enjoy walking-
it's not a problem
so we have the high-end gucci
we have also in bet- in some other shopping centres we have uh non-branded items
like i said there are shops uh that are not gucci and cartier
um have you heard of things like g2000
yes uh
they are regular
uh hm regular brands
and you can buy your souvenir t-shirts in chinatown
right

um and do you have a hotel in mind
so you need to look for a hotel
so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to- show you this place
it's called the botanical gardens
alright
okay
this is the botanical gardens in singapore
okay
you can be there as early as five am to twelve midnight but i guess you won't be spending that many hours there
so you can be- anyway the park opens as early as five am
uh so you can be there
alright and anytime you are ready to leave you can leave the gardens
but if you have- if you plan to spend a bit more time you can go to the orchid garden inside the botanical gardens
but that is- there is an admission charge there
but the orchid garden only opens at eight thirty
so do you know what you're going to see in the orchid garden
uh majority would be orchids
okay
but the botanical gardens you will have all the other plants out in the botanical garden including a small jungle
yes
and there will be some birds uh there as well
okay
okay
so is there any other information that you require for the uh photography session
okay
now assuming that your hotel is somewhere in orchard road there are buses available
these are the buses available
uh there are quite a number of buses it's all stated on the website
okay if you want to take the mrt train station- mrt the subway trains
it is also possible
uh yes
this is at the north end of the gardens
yah it's quite close to the garden already
yah
otherwise if you uh because there are many entrances and exit to the garden itself
yah
so uh it's fine if you take the mrt you can arrive at the uh mrt uh the botanical garden station
okay so
so we can close this uh website
okay
so next we want to go to the uh universal studio
okay sure
okay this is uh some of the photos that you can get uh to do when you see the uh hollywood characters
uh you- it is uh- the- so are you thinking of after your morning photography student- uh studio uh- photography session to proceed straight to the universal studio
okay
uh it is not that far away
alright
what you can do is you go back on the mrt
and you take the circle line
uh and you will alight at the harbourfront
uh and you will alight at the harbourfront
yes
alright
to get into the universal studio
uh no from the botanical garden it's um mrt and you can change the sentosa uh train at harbourfront
yah
so that's how you can get in
and straightaway when you alight uh at the station uh to- by taking the sentosa express you're already at universal studio
alright
okay
so uh it will be just about right because the opening hours opens at ten am
right through seven pm
it's- okay it's sixty eight dollars
yes
okay
these are the tickets here
okay
alright
okay
so uh the- i think the transformer ride is very interesting
okay
and how much time do you think you want to spend there
oh before dinner
alright
okay
so in the night time you want to do uh- you want to go to a bar
alright
okay
it's called zouk
z o u k
yes
okay this is the park
yah this is a club
alright
okay
do you need me to tell you the dress code
okay
dress code will be uh party attire
and because they have won uh few years
yes
okay
did- yah
okay
again it's quite accessible by the uh subway train station
you just have to walk a little bit
the closest station would be uh at the tiong bahru mrt train station
okay
uh it's about ten minutes' walk from the mrt
uh it's about ten minutes' walk from the mrt
well you don't have the lights out there
it's uh pretty uh simple on the outside so you don't see like a lot of uh new lightings
so if you want to party uh this will be one of the nightspot
okay
yah
okay
another club that i can uh recommend you will be called okay this is the other uh club
alright that uh we have in singapore
which is again pretty uh popular with the local as well as the tourists
which is again pretty uh popular with the local as well as the tourists
okay it's called one-altitude
okay it's called one-altitude
yes
alright
and it finish late like till two am
this is about the usual time that people goes to the club
and the other uh club that i like to introduce you would be called one-altitude
and the other uh club that i like to introduce you would be called one-altitude
so this is uh- you have top of the world feeling
this is- it's actually a bar
a gallery and bar
you got a good view uh from the top of the building
you got a good view uh from the top of the building
okay again this is very accessible by the mrt
you alight at raffles mrt
okay
okay so you have two clubs to go to already
okay so you have two clubs to go to already
alright
let me just show you this
now this is a shopping complex called paragon
now this is a shopping complex called paragon
okay
uh it is located on orchard road
uh it is located on orchard road
and the closest mrt train station would be called orchard station
it's just five minutes' walk from orchard station
it's just five minutes' walk from orchard station
so this is one option other the other option- so you have all the branded goods out there
and because you are a tourist now when you buy something from a bigger company
it's the- it's the vat you know
but we call it gst here
it stands for goods and services tax
okay when you get the form uh you can always claim back the seven per cent upon uh you leaving singapore
okay
now if you are going to put your purchases in your handbag
alright
it's okay
you will check-in as usual at the check-in counters
after you get your boarding pass you go inside the immigration
okay
immediately after the immigration you will be able to see a big sign that says gst
okay just approach counter with your purchases and your uh receipt alright that has been stamped uh by the retailer and you present this to the officer
and they will be able to refund you your money in whatever currency you wish
so it's very easy
okay
if you want to put your purchases in your luggage then it's slightly different
okay
what you can do is your purchases are going to be put inside your luggage when you arrived in the airport-
now bring your purchases your uh receipt to the- and of course your passports and tickets
present all these items and the officer will do a stamp for you
okay now bring everything to do your normal check-in at the check-in counter
okay
once you have done your check-in with your boarding pass proceed into the immigration counter and you look for the gst sign again and you will be able to get back your tax refund
uh sounds easy
okay
alright
so that's how you claim back the gst
and- okay so this is one uh shop but to the shopping again for your branded goods
this would be one of the options
i think the prices here for branded goods are still uh very competitive

okay
night safari uh opens in the night time
it is located in the north of singapore
yes
okay
so this is the uh night safari
okay
uh okay
when you are inside the park because this is a park that opens in the night time
uh if you want to take photography uh you would have to take it without flash
okay for- if you're taking on the animals then you have to take that without the flash
yah
yes
alright
okay
park
uh in the night safari you would see uh things like uh the giraffes-
uh in the night safari you would see uh things like uh the giraffes-
okay
uh the malayan tapir the leopards
okay
so these are the things that you're going to see in the uh night safari park
the uh okay
so these are the- alright
alright
and uh you don't have to walk in the park if you don't want to
yes
it's um tram
okay
so you can get on the tram ride and uh you will see more than seventy per cent of the animals
yes the tram ride is included in the ticket
yes the tram ride is included in the ticket
the whole ride will cost you forty minutes
alright it will take about-
uh and if you don't want to take the tram you can do walking as well
uh yes you can also walk
there are three trail that's one that you're looking at
it's called the leopard's trail
uh on this trail of course you see other animals but the highlight would be to see the leopard's trail
uh this is located near the entrance area
there are uh two shows there
okay one is called the uh- okay this show here
uh and the other one would be the creatures of the night
that's what you're looking at now
okay
this is the uh- okay this is the creature of the night
now basically it's a twenty minute show uh and they will just bring out some animals for you to see
now basically it's a twenty minute show uh and they will just bring out some animals for you to see
okay
uh the other show the fire show will be at eight o'clock and nine o'clock
and that the fire show is located outside the park
and that the fire show is located outside the park
so once you get into the night safari you have to buy the tickets
and you enter in
you can buy without the tram ride if you want to
uh but i would recommend that you take the tram uh and the walk
in the tram ride there will be a person a guide doing the commentary
uh what animals you are looking at
but on the walk uh you will be doing the walk by yourself
get to see about uh more than seventy per cent of the animals
and the balance of thirty per cent you will have to do the walk to see the rest of the show
uh no more sites at the night safari but in the day time-
we have the morning zoo which is next door
uh the morning zoo opens in the day
and you will be seeing a lot of the mammals
that can only be seen in the day zoo but not in the night safari
uh yes
because the day zoo it's only open in the day and the day you wouldn't require the flashlights right
yes
uh yes
you are allowed to take pictures of the animals without flash
but if you are going to just take your friends and plants or the entrance area uh then it is fine with the flash
alright

and-
yah
uh where- depends on where you're staying
uh i've got a map here

of where funan centre is
and uh it's also near where we have old colonial buildings
so you have the address there
it says funan jewellery but don't worry about it

uh your thousand singapore dollars is for your stay and your travel right
uh huh
che~ hum uh let me see
hum uh let me see
uh just hold on a while
do you mind staying in chinatown
yah this is a- eh your hotel- uh the funan centre is in fact within walking distance
you sound like a young man
uh i just- was found someone a hotel
you're physically able
you're physically able
uh we have many places that are also uh accessible to people who have difficulty walking
uh we have many places that are also uh accessible to people who have difficulty walking
i'm gonna show you the hotels in chinatown
just a minute
okay
uh you were able to get it on the screen now
yah you can see on the left-hand side a list of the hotels
correct yes
yes a day
yes a day
i'm not sure about that because- anyway around there you can get a lot of um food
very reasonably priced food once you step out of the hotel
if you want to be adventurous and try street food chinese food by which i think filipino food is quite close right
cheap hotels in sngapore
uh huh
uh no no official shangri-la hundred and twenty five hotels
there you go
can you see hundred and nineteen dollars
okay
yes
it's a good location
yes that's right
and you could walk to your- funan mall
you can walk
i think for a able-bodied young man you could walk
maybe ten or fifteen minutes
fifteen minutes slow walk okay
no you get to see too right
uh do you see it
oh uh no not the e~ m and not the- not m and not amara because they're more for business people
yes
trengganu street yes
uh yes that's right
the reviews
uh wait
i'm losing you now
ah it's better
this is better
uh it- it is a converted uh shophouse so the buildings you saw were are the exterior
they're old buildings heritage buildings so the rooms are narrow
you can see from the picture
you get bedroom- yah
uh let me see
they should be air-conditioned
there it is
is it with uh- there's tea coffee making flat screen tv cable channels toiletries and hair dryer
uh well it doesn't say ac but i think it should be
i think it's-
yah
uh yes that's right
uh yes that's right
hmm yes
uh could- uh i'm losing you a little bit now
uh yes
uh slow walk fifteen minutes
so-
yes let me see here
it was about- you can put in a sixty dollars you know
it was about- you can put in a sixty dollars you know
uh just round it up
yah round it up
hotel lai chun yuen
uh it is of i think uh it used to be a chinese opera house if they're using the name it should be
uh the building- original building is pre-war
yah pre-war but it- they have all been um given up by their original owners and restored completely and in the case of the hotels they have been converted into hotels
so what happens is sometimes they buy up a few units and join them up
yah so they- that's how they get you all the rooms uh with a on suite bathroom
yah the original buildings had one bathroom at the back
yah
yes that's right
not a problem at all
not in singapore anyway
which is good
yah now it's better
yah now it's better
what is happening over there
is your microphone falling off
uh huh
okay
what else uh are you interested in
uh there's a new museum uh about three or five minutes walk away uh and it's the chinatown uh heritage museum
uh there's a new museum uh about three or five minutes walk away uh and it's the chinatown uh heritage museum
i don't know if they have a website
it is interesting because uh it shows you- but these old buildings were used for long long ago
how people lived
yah i'm trying to get it now
uh not chinese history but the way of life in singapore
uh not chinese history but the way of life in singapore
alright
it's okay
let me see huh
and it's just you know see this is how the chinese arrived from china and it gives you a very good insight
yah they take personalities uh who used to live in that area
maybe not in the same room but they tell their story in there
so you can connect the transformation from that kind of room to your hotel room
same kind of- uh kind of building
you know what i mean
you know what i mean
so it's uh- sorry
chinatown heritage centre not museum okay
i think ten dollars is more than enough
it doesn't say here
uh it doesn't give the price but let me see okay
oh there ten dollars i'm right
yah
and you see here uh-
sri mariamman temple
it's within walking distance of your hotel
yes
so if you want to shop i suggest you- the first one in the museum and then go to funan later
the shops tend run a little bit later at about ten o'clock
no in the morning
no in the morning
yes
yah that's right
or forty five minutes
some people just rush through it because they're not interested
but if you really look at things an hour would be more than enough
yes
you- uh i suggest you go round the shops and check the prices and what accessories they give you
and then you can tell them honestly you're price checking so they give you good prices and then you can decide where to buy from
uh it malls i think that's the one i know of because i shop there too
uh let me try
uh we have it fairs in singapore
if you like crowded shopping you should come during the fair time
so - we just had one
ah yah
uh it can be very hot in singapore so bring very light clothing
okay centigrade about thirty three degrees
uh yah
on a good cool day uh if it rains maybe twenty eight twenty nine
on a good cool day uh if it rains maybe twenty eight twenty nine
but it will catch up to thirty two
but it will catch up to thirty two
okay
july no this one is electronic components
we have- no these are trade shows
no this is not it
it fairs open fair
i put in consumer
okay
you can try comex i think
yes comex
okay this is in september though
uh huh
yah
this one- uh if you have a look at this one comex is held at suntec city which is another convention centre but they turned the hall into a big shopping area
so if it'll be a furniture fair or a food fair or a-
okay
no uh let me- do you want to get into here
alright
are you able to read it
is that right
yah so usually it will be around that time
you see in march we just had an it show
but we have four
i think september is one of the ones
anything else you would like to buy in singapore or see
yah that's- if it's on
uh yes there are shops- there are lots of shops there you know to buy clothings uh fashion other items
and if-
okay
peninsula shopping centre has many uh shops selling cameras
so again check out the prices there
wait uh and it's also near to chinatown
you could walk or take a bus
two bus stops away
yah
yes
yes you see it's north bridge road
uh chinatown is in south bridge road area just separated by the river and you walk a little bit and you'll reach peninsula plaza
and you can also eat there and then you can walk to the shops but they haven't- the camera shops haven't put themselves online
uh if you come in- on a weekend and you want to meet filipinos and eat filipino food you go to what we called little filipino- little philippines
uh it's actually lucky plaza
that's where all the filipinos congregate and so on the fourth and fifth floors uh we have what si~ shops serving just filipinos
a very old one down in orchard road which is the shopping area
a very old one down in orchard road which is the shopping area
are you getting it on your screen
and there are buses from chinatown to orchard road so if you come and you include a sunday on your visit on sunday you go up there and you'll see lots of filipinos you can get perhaps a better variety of filipino food because sunday is when- well are assumed to be off work yes
uh the whole day you can get lunch dinner there but you want to eat filipino food in singapore
uh i believe there's a stall at the airport also run by a filipino
uh i can't remember at which it's actually at the place where uh the staff eat
uh i can't remember at which it's actually at the place where uh the staff eat
it's a staff canteen but you can go there and i used to eat there filipino food
it's a staff canteen but you can go there and i used to eat there filipino food
uh which uh- is it catholic or uh-
christian
new life christian centre yes
i heard of new life
is it called christian-
okay
i put in singapore and i'll try and get you the address
okay we have new life community church
can you recognise which one is affiliated to your church
oh
uh that is an interesting part of singapore also
you can do some tasting of chinese food-
uh there
and if i'm not mistaken there's also a filipino restaurant there uh because i was there recently and i passed it
uh no this one you need to take a bus uh because the trains don't go exactly there
but it's an interesting quarter of singapore
yes um there are food especially to try
a blend of chinese and malay food and as i said there is a filipino uh like a café there-
nearby
nearby
so- yah and it's at one eight three east coast road
um you see the instructions at the bottom here
um you see the instructions at the bottom here
uh with an arrow
op~
yah i think allow yourself forty five minutes
but it's fun to go
it's interesting place
let- just a minute
let me get the- what is the services
let me get the- what is the services
okay it's at eleven thirty am
because on sundays it's off peak for public transport
uh the buses uh don't come as frequently as they do during uh office days and of peak hours
peak hours they send many more buses in the early mornings and in the evenings when people are going to work and coming back
so that is why you need to allow time
but then on the trains it's only about four minutes or five minutes off peak the most
usually-
usually about three minutes
no
it's- yah it's more relaxing on sundays
you could go all the way north and visit the night safari if you want
or-
yes that's right
say what are your interest back in philippines
what do you like to do
beach just to swim right
uh sentosa siloso beach
okay i'm gonna get you a beach in sentosa island
uh yah
uh exactly
uh we were told it's a filipino term for jealousy
so it is correct huh
uh i don't know ho~
uh no siloso is just the name of this stretch of the beach on sentosa
there are beach shelters
you can eat there you know uh there are bistros you could- there are also like ice cream parlors
things like that
and we have beach parties also sometimes
yes siloso yes
or tanjong
there's another beach called tanjong beach
uh on sentosa
uh sentosa island has attractions also but this is just the beach area i'm showing you
wait uh let's uh- no uh let me see
okay
they're both very good
you see on the island they have free bus service to bring you so you could go to both beaches
you see on the island they have free bus service to bring you so you could go to both beaches
yah
and you can take- let me get on the mrt for sentosa
just a minute yah
this is our mass rapid transit system
so you come in here
are you following my mouse
see at changi airport
yah and you can go all the way down here
it's the east-west line
and you- and you can connect down to uh raffles place
or- you can connect down to- sorry
city hall
and then you change to go to dhoby ghaut uh which is a major interchange and then you take another train you're down right into chinatown
beach to chinatown okay
can you see harbourfront
yes uh-
the ride itself would be- maybe five minutes you know
two and a half minutes very short
and then here you take a shuttle into sentosa which is at the bus station within walking distance
and then here you take a shuttle into sentosa which is at the bus station within walking distance
you walk about five minutes and where the public buses stop you can take a sentosa bus in for one dollar
um hmm
yes uh the bus stops have the entire route for- not the entire route but the route of the buses where they're going to go
you just- if you're taking a public bus you just need to be on the correct side of the road so you can ask anybody at the bus stop
they'll be able to tell you
and uh when you are at the airport go down to the mrt station and buy a card
uh you need to pay a small deposit
i think it's about ten dollars or seven dollars which you get back uh when you go back home
and maybe there's a small charge for making the card you know just a nominal fee
but the deposit- you put extra deposit is for your travel fare so you don't have to worry about carrying the correct amount of money
uh yes
at the major stores they would accept yes
if you pay it on the streets in chinatown if you buy souvenir say three souvenirs for ten dollars then they would not accept
yah you need some cash
you might want to change it when you arrive at the airport
you might want to change it when you arrive at the airport
the rates are quite decent
so- that - if you are staying just two days there's no point hunting for a money changer who usually gives a slightly better rate
yes
yes you can change at the airport and then go to the basement where the mrts which stands for mass rapid transit
uh get your travel card
so once you've got your local money you can buy your travel card and they will supply you a map
at least they used to a map and they can both also be very informative
about how to travel you know if you're not sure there they will give you very good directions
nature-re~ uh related
one of my best uh places is this place and you should bring your binoculars if you're going
yes sungei buloh
it means bamboo river
uh sorry
buloh is bamboo and- so river bamboo
if you go at low tide or even high tide you can see mudskipper- uh you can see a uh tree climbing crabs
if you come in december you can see migratory birds
uh that fly from um uh- as far away as mongolia and some continue to perth
now let me see
kranji is where it's located
and then you take this bus called the kranji express
yah
he'll give you a ticket
so- yah
so when you're at sungei buloh check out the times that they leave sungei buloh back to the station so you can time yourself on your walk
buloh~ sungei buloh
then- or you can continue on the bus and just visit other places
this is just some of them that he will drop you
uh it's a gardenasia
i think it's a nursery
uh bollywood is also nursery
hay dairies they have got goats from all over the world
yes
uh if you want to watch migratory birds in december then- oh anyway from september to march then you need like half a day or one day there
uh if you want to watch migratory birds in december then- oh anyway from september to march then you need like half a day or one day there
no uh they will be there but the thing is you might enjoy it and walk around and there are trails over the uh marine life and trails over uh ponds uh in there
so if you're a birder a twitter they may normally spend half a day there
uh we have attractions uh if you want like the bird park
yes
we have the jurong bird park
if you are lazy to uh look at birds you know through your binoculars you want them in your face-
and you can see them- there you can have them flying right in front of you
yah
so- uh this one is not so wild because it's an attraction but sungei buloh is wild
it's re~
if you want more information on wild places uh you- when you come in to singapore you might want to contact someone from uh nature society and we have nature guides there
or they-
they are the more hardcore people you know
hardcore
you want to-
really wild uh-
uh it's a- yes but there are guides in there that can help you
or like you can see horseshoe crab
and there are public walks that you can join
yah
yes
so the- this is focused on wilderness whereas places like the zoo and the bird park is more attractive you know for tourists who don't want to get too muddy or dirty or-
uh you should walk uh at traffic light junctions and you know you should walk carefully
don't jaywalk
uh it's actually for your own safety because the traffic can be you know uh they follow traffic rules but people are used to people not walking when the lights are red so you should just follow the rules there
uh not to litter
uh yah you can bring in gum to chew if you need to chew gum but just don't bring in great quantities because you're not allowed to import chewing gum
so we can't afford to have people chewing gum
yah
if you're in a place of worship uh it's better not to photograph people
uh and maybe you want to ask the temple people before you do the photographing
if you're photographing the architecture like the statues uh the facade that's-
quite alright
yah that's-
that's okay
we have all religions in singapore uh but um as the majority three quarters of us are chinese
the buddhism and taoism is very uh visible in singapore
in fact within walking distance of your hotel there is a fairly new buddhist temple and it's huge
uh i propose you visit another one that is further away
uh you can walk too but it's not so near as this new temple
yes
okay here it is
telok ayer street is just one street away from where you are
telok ayer street is just one street away from where you are
uh that's what we call it
unfortunately the street name is also- this name is chinese dialect
the street name is telok ayer street which is-
yah which is water bay street
can you see here
it means water bay street
yes
and uh if you go there you allow some time to visit uh mosque hm- two doors away from it
it's just been newly renovated again but it's about as old as this temple
this temple actually dates from the eighteen twenties when it was a little shrine
this temple actually dates from the eighteen twenties when it was a little shrine
so it's one of the oldest in singapore
uh no i'm afraid it's a bit more like a tourist attraction except on feast days
uh the one way you get to see a lot of monks is the one very near uh buddha tooth relic
buddha tooth relic
this is also a good-
this one is strictly buddhist
this one is strictly buddhist
yah
thian hock keng is a buddhist and taoist so you get a lot of other deities that are common to both religions but here you get mostly buddha
this is south bridge road
yes sorry
yes they might if you look very obviously like a tourist
okay
can i show you the- these photos here
okay
so this is grander looking
it's new uh you see
yes
yes you can go inside
uh make sure you use the side door
the there are doors in the centre and doors to the left and right of the centre
use the side doors
yah the main door is for the temple priest to go in
there's- there's another one
uh that is- this one is also in chinatown and it's a heritage temple
okay
no
no but-
no uh but here the tem~ uh the sri mariamman if you use your camera inside they'll ask you for a camera fees
just a few dollars
the those are statues so it's very spectacular for uh photography
very colourful uh
it's hindu
this is hindu
you see this picture here
and this is very- uh this is- has a very authentic view because people are still uh praying here they're worshiping here so you should go in the morning before twelve
yes
they close from about twelve to about four four thirty
they have a short break and then they re-open in the evening
so either that or you go in the evening
yes if you want to use your camera you get better light also
uh they have a small door open you can get in but inside there's no activity there's nobody praying you know it's- the temple priests are not around
yah
right
okay
anything else
i'm losing you
uh huh
yes
now it's better
you're most welcome jes
hope to see you
yah
bye
hi good morning-
uh good afternoon
this is uh tour guide one
lynnette here
and can i have your name please
okay and how can i help you
okay
uh which part of the year are you planning to come
uh which part of the year are you planning to come
and how many people are coming with you
okay and ha- uh okay what do you and your friends like to do
okay and ha- uh okay what do you and your friends like to do
the last one what did you say
okay
so uh you like to see culture history-
okay
okay so uh for the culture-wise
singapore has a few culture
uh yes
we have the malay
arab culture
we also have the indian culture
the chinese culture
ah yes
there are souvenirs available but they will be all uh chinese related kind of souvenir
so this is just one street scene in chinatown
alright
yah this is just a street scene in chinatown
so chinatown is actually just next to the singapore river
they have uh these carvings
uh and it will be a little bit different from the other culture
alright
okay
more- most of these chinatown houses i would say they are in the range of about a hundred twenty years now
they were- yah they we're built in the early nineteen hundreds
so the different- and the chinese are also divided into various dialect speaking
okay
dialects are spoken languages
yah
uh languages will be both spoken and written
so uh dialect meaning it's just spoken language
so this people they came from china and they live in uh various so-called uh provinces in china
and they speak different dialect
so when they come here uh not every one of them would speak mandarin
so when they came here they still live in different street uh in singapore
so when they came here they still live in different street uh in singapore
uh i would say it's a popular spot for tourist to visit
if you want to learn to see the chinese um houses
these are just some old photograph of uh chinatown
okay this is actually uh a bullock cart
okay this is actually uh a bullock cart
motor vehicles came later part of the years
so they started using bullock cart to transport their goods
uh and uh yah mainly for transportation of goods
it's a three-wheel vehicle
and you also mentioned about history right
and you also mentioned about history right
okay
okay

uh there is no show but there are some uh tv programmes that you can stop to see
uh there is no show but there are some uh tv programmes that you can stop to see
okay so- uh no culture show for this uh museum
it is housed inside a shop house
okay so you can see the layout of the first level
okay
and the second level
okay and the third level
alright
there's only a lift but the lift is quite small
yah
so you are young right
so you should be okay
so it's accessible by the mrt
okay
so these are just some of the things that you'll be looking at inside the uh- uh inside the uh museum
okay
yes
uh ancestors of singaporeans
okay
uh in the beginning uh there were actually some native singaporeans who live here
uh in the beginning uh there were actually some native singaporeans who live here

we had kings to rule us
they were about five of them
uh kings yes
uh kings yes
there were kings in singapore
alright
and he uh named us singapura from temasek he renamed us as singapura uh and that's how singapore gets its name
alright
now the last king of singapore because he was pursued by his uh enemies
now the last king of singapore because he was pursued by his uh enemies
and he went over to melaka setup and other kingdom there
and he went over to melaka setup and other kingdom there
alright
and so it was pretty quiet out here again until the year of eighteen nineteen when raffles came to singapore
so when he came here we have approximately about a thousand people living here
yes he's a european
alright
now when he came here later on he decided to make singapore into a free port
so from then on many people from all over the world started to come here
yes for trade and business
and to seek for employment as well
uh so there are people from all over the world coming here
for example we have people from the nearby malay archipelago area
okay
so the malay archipelago we will be talking about the indonesian uh islands
alright
we are talking about uh malaysia
malaya at that time
uh we are uh- so basically nearby to singapore we call this the malay archipelago
yah
and we also have people coming from china
alright
we also have people coming from europe
and we have people coming from the arab countries
so the main group of people would be from these countries
uh yes
because of our history
okay
uh buddha relic temple
that is in chinatown
so there are a lot of things to do in chinatown
uh the buddha relic temple is just located in chinatown
and you could do those temple when you are going down to chinatown
and you could do those temple when you are going down to chinatown
alright
uh yes
this is all uh built uh just in chinatown itself
chinatown has a few lanes
alright it's not just one street
uh and one of the attractions uh you are thinking of visiting is this buddha relic temple
you can walk inside but there is a dress code
for example uh no like shorts
uh singlet of course is not appropriate uh dress code for uh visiting any places of worship here
oh yes
there are local people who goes in uh to do their prayers uh during the opening hours of the temple
but otherwise uh most of the time in uh chinese temples uh it will be more crowded when uh- like on special days
uh the first day and the fifteenth day of the chinese calendar which is different from the western calendar
okay
uh the buddha uh birthday
yes you will find that uh more people would be worshiping uh otherwise it's uh- well that is- it's not that crowded to visit the buddha relic temple
quite a walk
yah
yah but it's okay
yes
so uh i think uh it again depends on whether you want to visit um uh it's it all depends whether you want to visit the chinatown heritage centre
if you were planning to do that then you have to allocate about one hour in the- at chinatown heritage centre or minimum forty minutes i would say
the buddha relic temple approximately uh twenty minutes
yes
yes
yes that's right
so do you want to eat some uh chinese food in chinatown
okay
do you want to go to a restaurant
or you want to do just uh non-air conditioned food places
uh do you know this food called chinese dim sum
okay
yah
so these are just some uh like uh small little food and they normally steam them in a bamboo container
otherwise you- there are also some dishes that is fried
uh so that would be something that you can get uh in chinatown
alright chinese dim sum in-
chinatown huh
yes
okay
night life in singapore i would like to recommend you to this- are you talking about clubs
are you talking about clubs
okay we have a very famous club
uh yes the-
uh yes the-
uh yes the- especially the younger people and the young at heart
okay we have a very famous uh club in singapore and we call it zouk
okay we have a very famous uh club in singapore and we call it zouk
have you heard of this club
it's very famous
okay these are just some of the scene uh in the club
as you can see it's very crowded
alright
so this-
alright
so this is one of them
uh the night scene
okay
oh okay
now our uh hours- our party hours uh we properly finish around three am
where is- it doesn't go through throughout the night
alright
yah it's a very famous club in singapore
alright
alright
yes
uh this is on the west line
okay
assuming that your hotel is located somewhere in uh orchard road
uh it will take you approximately- uh it's actually quite nearby but because there's no direct line from orchard road so you will have to uh plan about uh twenty minutes
because you will have to change line
so another uh so the dress code do you need to tell- to uh- do you need me to tell you about dress code
so another uh so the dress code do you need to tell- to uh- do you need me to tell you about dress code
i mean uh night uh clubs outfit
yah
okay
okay another- yes
uh yes
okay another uh club that i would like to introduce you would be this one that i'm going to show you now
this is quite a few clubs in there
it's called saint james power station
yah
yes
there are few uh different kind of clubs that you can see uh in this power station
it's not used as a power station anymore
there are clubs in there
so you have different themes in this uh park so you can hop from one to the other
so- uh yah what i mean is you can go- if you don't like this club you can go till then move on to the next one and the next one
alright
so this is in saint james power station
yes
gadget
uh computers laptop so on and so forth
uh computers laptop so on and so forth
okay
now this is one uh uh shopping complex uh that you can uh visit
it's called funan digilife or funan it mall
okay this is the funan it mall
yes
the location is just near the- it's about seven minutes' walk from city hall mrt
yes
it's quite convenient to ride the mrt uh in singapore
so uh like i mentioned this is near the city hall mrt train station
oh and yes we haven't uh introduced you to any hotel yet
okay
so the it mall there are a number about five levels of shopping
and these uh every other shop sells it related products
for example from cameras right up to laptops to accessories uh can be found in this mall
uh yeah
so you can spend- up to you you know the- how many hours you take to find uh the product that you wanted to buy
okay
for the hotels in singapore they have various uh ranges uh in terms of price range
uh and of course we have the three hundred to four hundred range and four hundred and above
or even the uh what you call the value hotels the budget hotels
or even the uh what you call the value hotels the budget hotels
alright
so- okay i can give you these budget hotels
okay
these are some of the budget hotels that we have in singapore
okay uh one of the companies that runs these ho- budget hotels is called uh hotel eighty one
yes
and they are pretty small hotel
so this is nearer for you dickson or chinatown
okay
there's also this budget hotel in chinatown
but just bear in mind the rooms are not that big
yah
so price range would be in the region of about a hundred and fifty
price range
okay
so these are just some pictures of the-
yah
so there are few uh budget hotels located in orchard road
even this one at beach road
yes
orchard o r c h a- orchard road yah
but because you are going to spend just a few days here so i would recommend that you stay closer um around chinatown
that's one at beach road
you can stay in this uh beach road area as well
and this one it's also okay
hotel grand chancellor
but if you want to stay in orchard road there are also other hotels out there as well
alright
okay
would you want to consider backpackers
you like uh backpackers hotel
okay we have backpackers hotel
just now we mentioned about you like history right
okay
can i recommend you one hotel budget hotel
uh that is located just right in the heart of another cultural area
and this one- yah this is called sleepy sam
uh just now i mentioned about the budget hotel like hotel eighty one
that's one in chinatown
so you also mentioned about you like history
so we already talked about chinatown
so that is the chinese area
yah
okay
kampong is a malay word it means village and glam is actually named after glam trees
kampong is a malay word it means village and glam is actually named after glam trees
so there used to be a lot of glam trees that's found in this kampong but no longer now
and the- it's uh also near the mrt called bugis
so it will be a different kind of location from the chinatown budget hotel
yes
okay
uh it all depends
you can go to the guides online and you can call up the guides if you want to do a half-day tour
uh the charges depends alright on the guide
uh normally uh the guides will charge like let's say uh in the range of- from- for one person two person it doesn't matter
okay from the range of let's say- because this would be like a private basis or small group of people
okay from the range of let's say- because this would be like a private basis or small group of people
um and if you are just talking about uh walking tours uh that- they will charge probably in the range of twenty five dollars per hour
yes approximately
yes
yes
so that would be about uh- no i mean like i said it doesn't matter how many of you
uh it's- so yah so approximately about twenty five dollars per hour
yah
okay otherwise you can walk around on your own uh if you choose to stay in sleepy sam
the uh picture
there is a picture of a mosque and this is called the sultan mosque
this picture will show you a street scene in uh kampong glam
uh over here of course it's used to be the malay quarters
you will find malay cuisine out here
uh yes
so malay cuisines are a little bit more spicy food compared to the chinese food
and do you want me to introduce you to some malay food
alright
the malay food uh compared to the chinese will be more spicy
so we have like simple dishes called mee siam
mee siam is actually the small thin white noodles
um and we put in a sour kind of a sauce uh together with this- with a hard-boiled egg
um so this is uh um mee siam
uh a little bit spicy it's a little bit sour and spicy
uh a little bit spicy it's a little bit sour and spicy
uh this is um mee siam
alright
okay mee siam- mee soto it's a noodles with- cooked in um chicken straps
with a little bit of soup
um not that spicy just a tinge of spice
alright
okay sure
and there are also some uh restaurants in uh kampong glam
alright
we call it the nasi padang
yes
nasi is um a malay word it means rice
okay and you get to choose your dishes in uh to go with your rice
yes you get your rice and uh you have this uh dishes like for example fried chicken uh vegetables but of course they are spicy
um and uh so that is uh malay food yah in uh in kampong glam nasi padang
okay
and also you can have another malay food called uh satay
okay this food is um uh marinated meat
okay this food is um uh marinated meat
you can have uh chicken uh mutton uh marinated and they pierce through a skewer and it's barbecued over charcoal and you dip them with a peanut sauce uh spicy peanut sauce
you can have uh chicken uh mutton uh marinated and they pierce through a skewer and it's barbecued over charcoal and you dip them with a peanut sauce uh spicy peanut sauce
so that is another very typical uh malay food in uh where you can uh find in uh singapore
alright so this is malay food
uh the other- and you can also even get indonesian cuisine uh over in kampong glam
okay
so you have this like a smashed uh chicken with rice
we call it ayam penyet
uh that is-
yes that you can also find in kampong glam as well as in other parts of singapore
yes that you can also find in kampong glam as well as in other parts of singapore
uh in kampong glam itself
turkish
uh even mediterranean and there's even a swedish cafe uh that's found in kampong glam
yah
but like i said there are some arabic uh egyptian and turkish uh restaurants that's found in kampong glam itself
would you want to pay a visit to the mosque
okay
so again- yes you ca- you are permitted to enter the sultan mosque in kampong glam
yes
uh yes
uh yes
it is a living mosque so yes people do visit the mosque to pray
uh on other days uh that would be fine
but on friday uh they would not want to admit any uh visitors uh because they are going to have their prayers the congregational prayers on friday
alright
fourteenth of may is actually monday
uh yes
uh all the places of worship uh would have a dress code
so again um uh pants must be below the knee
uh shorts or t-shirts uh with the shoulders covered
uh there is no admission to visit the uh sultan mosque
uh but if you are non-muslim uh then we would not encourage you or we would uh ask you to refrain from getting into the prayer hall
okay
okay we have another culture called the indians
alright
the various ethnic area
uh so okay
so this little india again it is accessible by the subway
yes
little india in singapore
i think it's not-
yah okay
this is uh one of the street scene in uh little india
uh which period of time they are built
uh which period of time they are built
now little india uh would be in the range of about a hundred years old because they uh came a bit later after the chinese quarters
now little india uh would be in the range of about a hundred years old because they uh came a bit later after the chinese quarters
and it was very crowded so people started moving away
so they would be in the range of about a hundred years uh for little india
okay these uh vehicles we call them the trishaws
okay these uh vehicles we call them the trishaws
you don't see uh them plying um the other parts of the street- uh other parts of singapore because they have designated uh trishaws stations that these trishaws can park
so it's not going to be very easy for you to flag a taxi uh for example on an um on other roads in singapore
these are just used for sightseeing purposes
uh like i mentioned the trishaw men can only ride on designated uh roads in singapore
so you cannot tell him uh i want to uh go to changi airport then that's not possible
alright
yah
so designated area around the chinatown or the um uh at
yah little in- yah i'm sorry
so these were now used for sightseeing uh purposes
and you have to get to the trishaw station uh to get on to these trishaws
yes
yes
alright
we do have actually one more culture
uh yes
and that is located in the eastern part of singapore
we call them the peranakans
uh yah
nearby to one another
yes they are quite near to one another
yes they are quite near to one another
uh in the sense that uh it's just about less than half an hour from one another uh taking the mrt
yah
so you would be able to get from one place to another within half an hour if you're going to use the mrt
yah
so the next uh culture i'm going to introduce to you would be- it's easy for you to get to the museum called the peranakan museum
so the next uh culture i'm going to introduce to you would be- it's easy for you to get to the museum called the peranakan museum
again this is just near city hall mrt
and this group of people were originally chinese people
but uh what they have done is uh we call them the straits borns so when they came to singapore the men first came and they inter-married with the local non-malay lady- uh the local uh non-muslim ladies
and with it finally they evolved their own culture called the peranakans
the men
yes the men came from china and they inter-married with the local-
yah so this is a traditional dress
we call them- just now those ladies they are wearing their kebayas
very beautiful clothes
so this will be the peranakan museum
sorry
you can just go
uh no strict dress code
uh but of course you know uh no swimming attire
yes you can wear shorts uh if you want to go to the museum
that's fine
uh most of the time there will be no cultural show
uh but at uh let's say certain events yes can- uh there may be a show or a tour uh for the museum otherwise uh no for the time of may uh no we don't have like any special uh events that's going to come out

so if you miss the nine o'clock the next one is ten-fifteen
but the alternative is if you miss this you take the public bus and then you have to walk about half a kilometre from where the bus stops to the reserve
if you take this bus it drops you right outside

it's only at the places of uh worship that you have to be a bit more careful

yes of course
i think there are lots of flights
uh you can choose anyday actually
um what are your interests
um what are your interests
you want historical places but you also want universal studios huh
i see
i'm going to get into the website of universal studios first
yes
oh yah
no i think
i think about two years or so
i- not very clear there
i've been there
actually i went there before they opened
we visited the beautiful hotels there
i- oh yes
they are lovely hotels
yes that's right
so you could spend your time there- uh enjoying the sites on the island besides universal studios
uh let me get the package for you okay
yes thats's right
uh no but i have a bunch of nephews and nieces that i take out occasionally
very young ones
yes that's right
and their children
no actually my nephews and nieces are old
no actually my nephews and nieces are old
but uh- it's their children so i'm a grandaunt now
'cause when you buy the package then you will get uh-
'cause when you buy the package then you will get uh-
fees
yah
that's right
okay let me get your dates
fifth of april to seventh of april is that right
fifth of april to seventh of april is that right
are you thinking of staying on the island or uh-
well there are many hotels uh that are very uh moderately priced
uh in the chinatown area
uh in the chinatown area
and near to the island there are other business class hotels like a hundred over dollars
but if you want to save the money on- to spend time on sho~ uh spend the money on shopping and other things then we have the three-star hotels
uh the space is small within the rooms because most of the them are in conservation shophouses
ye~ yes very near
yes very near
uh convenience stores and shops and food and you can walk around and soak in the atmosphere
and they're also clean and they are you know
it's just that you don't have a lot of space in there
you don't have the luxury of the five-star
yes that's right
yes
uh just wear summer clothes lights cottons
we are warm and also wet
we get rain intermittently
off and on
in april yes it may rain
uh the- it's more the air-conditioning chilling up the place than the real cold
lots of places for shopping but uh do you see the screen resorts world singapore
or-
yes
yes
uh one uh- one us dollar- singapore dollar about one dollar twenty to an american dollar i think
i have it- checked
yes that's right
so you know this is a very high price uh hotel at five hundred
it's top end
um- so if you want- yah
and shopping
when the- a prince came to singapore long ago he saw an animal
and he was told that far away there is an animal called a singa which is lion
that's how- that's why it's singapore you see
but actually we don't have lions naturally found here
uh we have tigers or we once had tigers here in the jungle but not lions
so he could have seen a tiger
he could have seen a wild boar and he was given the wrong information
yah that's right
oh we've stuck with that name
uh maybe it's confusing for people who know their natural history right
uh we're multi-cultural
uh we're multi-cultural
chinese being the majority
and then we have malays and indians
and we also have uh eurasians europeans uh large expatriate of communities
so it's very easy to visit singapore
you can get all kinds of food
um and we are also very easy to move around i mean accessibility by train by uh-
if you compare with europe it's much cheaper
but it's so much easier and uh convenient to go by train and by bus
but it's so much easier and uh convenient to go by train and by bus
it's a-
so um- yes that's right
uh okay wait
i got the wrong hotels here
i put chinatown hotels and i got an american chinatown hotel
let me do it again
just a minute
the arabs as well to trade
so- and that dates back long ago
but uh in 1819 that's the most recent history a british official in the far east came here and he brought along free trade
okay um-
yes it is
i don't know the official crime rate but what i know is that you just need to be careful with your belongings and not be a bit careless so that you know people don't just help themselves- your things
english it's more english
or something that we call singlish which is- a mixture of english with the- chinese grammar
or something that we call singlish which is- a mixture of english with the- chinese grammar
uh why you so like that
that is-
it's singlish
uh that's similar why are you behaving this way
so it's a- you can probably make it out
uh it's fun too
um m hotel
okay i have got some hotels here for you
if you're interested in the island- m hotel is
it's hundred and sixty two dollars
yes that's right
it's and you can take it up from there uh
it's suite side uh island uh and take the shuttle bus into uh sentosa
so it's convenient
uh let me get the map of singapore for you
just a minute i enter-
yah hm
can you hear me clearly
can you- okay
let me get the memos
yes i can
you have universal studios right
you have universal studios right
okay good
okay good
i'm gonna get the map for the mass rapid transit
so that you can relate to where your hotel is
and where the island that you'd like to visit sentosa where it is located
yes
i'll get that on the screen in a moment just let me show you the location first
okay
yes
so just opposite harbourfront it's- the island of-
yes
just opposite it is the island of sentosa
and m hotel is- do you see tanjong pagar on the green line just nearby
it will be at sentosa island
so- shopping uh-
uh not so at m hotel because it is nearer the business district
but if you check into orchard road that is where the high end shops are
uh can you see the red- the-
red line
do you see it
near to number eight
uh if you want to go and stay in chinatown we have uh little boutique hotels in chinatown
and they're also the cheaper hotels which are- all the hotels there are usually not so spacious because most of them occupy uh conservation buildings
that's much shophouses
they join them up like 6 or 8 and they make a hotel
but they're very decent inside they're
but they're very decent inside they're clean
yes
twenty dollars uh budget- yah
twenty dollars uh budget- yah
twenty dollars probably you'll get a bed
twenty dollars probably you'll get a bed
i think you'll get a bed
uh hm uh you- if you're interested we get the hostels for you
let's see from the website how they are like
yes that's right
that's right
so uh well this one is good hangout hotels
uh can you see it
it's not really bad
it's a- shall i say it's a good one i think
it's a hostel but it's a good class hostel
hangout yes
we're trying to get it to come on
uh so it's uh up-market backpacker
uh the location is not bad
where we also have uh very good um uh train connections if you want to go elsewhere
where we also have uh very good um uh train connections if you want to go elsewhere
you can shop at dhoby ghaut which is within walking distance
by foot yes it's within walking distance and-
by foot yes it's within walking distance and- if you head at that-the other direction you will be in little india which is very full of heritage and culture and history which i believe you mentioned earlier
yes food
food are all over the place
uh let me get the room rates for you
they listed the budget but the room rate is two hundred and eighty five
yes net
uh but that's really not a backpacker rate
yes that's right
yes that's right
uh let me- okay
okay
this is another website
so you can have a private room
a hundred and twenty
hm yes
twenty- dollars is at dormitory
uh hm that's right
uh i'm guessing but i think the room may be a little bit bigger
okay
uh hm yes
so- yes
perak road- perak is actually a place in malaysia
uh and this area here is right in the heart of little india
so if you like indian culture uh this is the place to stay
but if your preference is for more business class hotel and hotel with
you- if you go there early in the morning let's say about nine o'clock or eight thirty you can see people marketing
uh shops
you can see flower garland weavers making fresh flower garlands
and you can try the indian food
uh lots of vegetarian shops there
uh well we don't call it a flea market just individual shops and the prices are very low
and then you can go into the hindu temples
they are very colourful
are you still on the same map
can you see the map of footprints
can you see serangoon road-
to the left perak road
so these little lanes are very short
uh two temples there's also a church there
it's full of life morning noon and night
the other place for culture would be chinatown
the other place for culture would be chinatown
uh bungee jumping i don't think we have unless it's purposely organised
uh bungee jumping i don't think we have unless it's purposely organised
uh we have- do you know flying fox
yes
we have activities like that
you know singapore we want to be a little bit safe
and bungee jumping you also need some high cliffs or something right
to-
uh jump off
so- yes
uh let me try the bungee jump first
oh we have this uh reverse bungee jump
have you heard of it
and this is very accessible
it is uh right along the singapore river
so if you open your eye to get a lot to see while you are upside down
uh it is uh set up right next to our singapore river and uh- i'm trying to get it
can you see the little picture on the right
that same space
okay i'll be honest with you i'm a coward i haven't been up on this
okay i'll be honest with you i'm a coward i haven't been up on this
yes
i- yes
and it's very accessible
yes uh and you can- you can also ride with him
yes uh and you can- you can also ride with him
yah
uh a lot of tourists come here
uh the zip-line i think you have to- what is it you call it
can you give it to me again
uh usually it's- yah usually it's organised for groups like you know college students
zip-line
where you zip from one end to the other end right
well we have it a little bit out of town
this is a megazip adventure park
yes it's on sentosa
yes it's on sentosa
you are brave if you dare to try zip-line
i did paragliding in uh thailand and uh my nieces thought i- i-
oh i enjoyed it yes
oh i enjoyed it yes
i enjoyed it very much uh except that you know the insurance doesn't cover that
uh bungee jump- uh it's the top of the hill i think
let me see huh
to the beach if i'm not mistaken
yes let me see it
all these especially at uh the big organisers like this they are very safe
don't have to worry
even the- uh the youngsters they do this zip-line
and they also go on their- what do you call it
roller blades and skateboards
uh oh there's another one that's a new one on sentosa
uh i forget the name
let me try
you get into uh a small building and you have these people help you float in the air
because the wind is blowing at you at high speed
uh you-
you put on a- uh no you put on a suit
you put on a protective suit and you wear tennis shoes
you put on a protective suit and you wear tennis shoes
i've done it so it can't be that scary
yes
we all survived it so don't worry
so even here can you see the harness is- fully fitted
uh that's what-
no um i was at the place where i could have tried it but uh i chickened out in the end
because it's too high speed for me
yes i sound young
it's a ploy
i-
the zip-line prices are not on
no they are showing-
yah something like that
um sometimes they organise it for a group and then they have special prices
it's built-in with other adventures
oh you can go into the casinos free of charge because you're a tourist
oh you can go into the casinos free of charge because you're a tourist
yes sentosa has one
yes sentosa has one
there's another one at marina bay sands
there's another one at marina bay sands
both of them are casinos
i think-
so i think it's from the top of the hill to one of the little islands there which is built off-just off the beach
so you're getting a view of the beach at sentosa
yes
uh what you are hearing is the sound of the wind
uh what you are hearing is the sound of the wind
if you look at the video i think that's the sound of the wind
uh just now when you saw the video with all the noise
that was the sound of the wind- because they are travelling at high speed
uh now we are putting up for you
okay
we have another zip-line at bedok reservoir road
are you getting it on your screen here
no me~megazip is what you just saw
no me~megazip is what you just saw
forest zip- yes forest adventure
and- okay
okay i'm getting them on the line uh to see if i can get any prices here
okay i'm getting them on the line uh to see if i can get any prices here
okay booking
yes
because i think they need a minimum uh okay
so we have their numbers there
that's right
hm yes
because they don't do it for you just for one person
they need to have a number of people
so you see here- do you see here now
places available
and your weight you cannot be- too heavy
the line will not hold
alright
yah that is uh-
yah that is uh-
let me get your- first-
um if you are very keen on culture then little india stay would be good otherwise- uh your uh m hotel would be good
and then- you see it took- so-
i would- say five days
have five or six days
i'm a relaxed traveller i
so- yah
yes too stressful
yes too stressful
yes
uh you may have to downgrade your hotel
uh since you are able to travel by the mass rapid transit the train system let me get you on the mrt map
you can find that you can get anywhere on it
yes then- if you spend your time-because when you shop you spend a lot of time
instead of that you can move to places
uh yes
that's right
then you can travel
do you see the map on your screen
yes
uh try all the different kinds of food and uh if you are used to eating um you know adventurous in food you don't need to sit down at the restaurant
then again not only do you save money
but uh you get uh authentic local food and you can intermingle with the locals at the food centres
i like a very old one
but first let me finish the map here okay
uh can you see changi airport
so if you take down the train down the green line
you just take it to tanah merah can you see it
look at number three on your right
can you see number three on your right
you would land at changi airport
so you just take a short shuttle to tanah merah and you take the westbound
and you would be in town
so depending on where you stay
uh if you choose to stay in little india you will switch at city hall to dhoby ghaut
can you see the red line
number eight is a major interchange station
and i think we saw one of them just now right
if you move the other way down to chinatown there are also many little hotels
and these hotels are converted shophouses
so it's uh bit of heritage that you're living in
so-
visit yes then you walk around
so if you're in little india you visit the little india area on foot
orchard then you go connect the- on the-
you go back to dhoby ghaut which is the major interchange and full of shops there
and eating places
you move north to orchard
you're going to say-
yes curry you can get- you take note of the name race course road
yes curry you can get- you take note of the name race course road
let me see if i can get it for you
there are lot of restaurants there
and along serangoon road which is the main road uh in little india you have many vegetarian restaurants also
in fact it's a great place uh for vegetarians in little india because many of the hindus here are vegetarian
oh yes
uh once you pay for a cup of coffee you can get a whole uh vegetarian meal- in little india
yes
you might need another uh a second portion if you have a healthy appetite
uh but otherwise you know uh it's uh more than enough
for me it's more than enough
and muthu curries is one of uh my favourite places
it's on race course
the area used to be a race course in the days of the british
the area used to be a race course in the days of the british
when-
yes
that's- you can take chili right
you can take chilli
uh okay
you can tell them and maybe they can uh modify you- modify a bit for you because we have many expatriates here but some of them like it really hot
the british expatriates uh love it hot
uh mirelle
yes
but you have to do the approaching
normally we mind our own business
so if you're lost we expect you to ask us and then we will be very helpful
but they will maybe not come out and approach you
although we're trying to change that mindset right now
yes
they would be very helpful and if you get in to any train station uh the officers there would be very happy to direct you
i was supposed to show you the- i want to just show you this about the uh okay
train you see the train map here
are you getting the maps or- ez-link card
and the best place to get it is at the airport
because uh what- you- okay
what is this
why am i getting this- pictures
you see
i think they tied up with a lot of people
uh with the ez-link card you can buy food as well
so if you put in a lot of money- you have to put in money first when you buy the card
okay
seve~ even sell them at seven eleven stores
like as i said if you get it at the airport uh i think they can supply you with a little map to go with it
let's see
okay
can you see at the bottom of the screen
uh twelve dollars yes
uh when you buy it at seven eleven stores they only charge you ten
when you buy it at the post office outlets it's five dollars
but- no it's the top-up value
um you need to put in money on top of this value
you see
that's right
so if you think you're gonna travel a lot you can put in more money
and when you leave at the airport leave some time to go back to the office and get your refund
yes
yes
that's right yes
so- uh normally at the singpost and seven eleven they think people are just using it as a convenience
serangoon road is little india
because they're both of the same line
yes
and then when you go to uh universal studios and the forest adventure you do it on another day
so uh that's what your two days will allow you to do
if you want more uh you need to stay about 5 days i think
then you need to visit- you can visit attractions like the zoo the night safari the bird park
and nature reserves
oh ah uh the zoo the bird park and the night safari are places that tourists normally go to
and other attractions on sentosa island
like that so
yes
at least five days i think
yes
and you can spend one day shopping also
okay
so do come mirelle
i'm holding a senior citizens travel pass that's how-
yes

uh universal studio
uh universal studio
yah that i would say may be saturday sunday yes you do have to queue a bit of time
uh maybe the more popular rides would be like transformer yes maybe you do have to queue like fifty minutes over the weekends
uh but otherwise i think it's manageable
yes that's right
and do you want me to recommend your hotel to stay in sentosa island
yes
yes
uh there are some hotels uh just within the universal studio area
there are some uh hotels out there okay
so you can choose to stay uh there as well
alright they are all relatively new hotels

okay there is one more hotel
remember earlier on i showed you the beach
uh okay there is uh resort uh hotel called the rasa sentosa
yah and it is actually the same chain as the uh shangri-la hotel
yah but it's a different kind of category of hotel
yah but it's a different kind of category of hotel
this is resort
okay so this one i can recommend you um this would be uh the hotel out on uh the island
so maybe you can stay uh one night out there
the rooms
okay the location
okay just- if you- now you are looking at the uh this is the back of the re~ uh sentosa resort
uh in the front area you- it overlooks the siloso beach

and it's quite a pretty uh hotel

so you planning to tour august seventeen to august uh eighteen
alright let see whether-
okay so it will show the rates

yah the rates uh would be singapor dollars uh four hundred and ten dollars per night
yah the rates uh would be singapor dollars uh four hundred and ten dollars per night

oh okay no it-
alright
okay what do your wife yourself and your child like to see
alright
okay we had lots of shopping options in singapore
so hm a lot of us goes to this road called orchard road to do our shopping
so hm a lot of us goes to this road called orchard road to do our shopping
and yes
and you can- you are actually looking at one of our uh newer shopping centre called ion on orchard road
if you look at the map below you see the pink highlighted area
that is orchard road
it's one straight road
alright and yes again you see some of the uh street seen in orchard road alright
alright and yes again you see some of the uh street seen in orchard road alright
full of greenery mature trees and every other building would be uh a shopping centre a hotel dining area on orchard road itself
yes and what would- what does she likes to shop for
what do you think she will like to shop for
uh we don't really call our shops market here
uh but just on the junction of this building uh ion uh beside the main road is orchard road the other road is scotts road
okay now this sell uh the i would say the budget and mid-range kind of products uh that ranges from hair accessories uh ear accessories right up to fashion and shoes
so that is one option that you may wanna consider
all these shops are just one shop so they don't really have chain shops
all these shops are just one shop so they don't really have chain shops
uh so it's not like the high fashion
uh so it's not like the high fashion
uh the other place that i would like to recommend uh for the cheaper options of shopping would be bugis alright
uh so this is an area another area again it's the shopping mall
uh i mean next to the bugis mrt train station if you look on your right-hand side
uh you can yah
yah you can see bugis junction
uh so if you want to talk about market then maybe that would be quite similar to what you are talking about
uh so there are no branded items there basically they are just uh fashionable wear
so this is the other shopping option
uh would you and your son like to look at any of our war museum federal
okay
so i would be able to recommend he- uh you a science centre which a lot of school children they like to go to this uh place call the science centre
uh again it's very accessible
you can take the subway again the mrt and goes towards the western part of singapore
so this is the science centre and your son will well enjoy like a few hours uh in this science centre itself alright
so this is the science centre and your son will well enjoy like a few hours uh in this science centre itself alright
so i'm going to show you like what are the exhibitions
okay inside here
but of course at certain time of the year they have different focus
so it's really very interactive very um stimulating actually for children as well as for adult
yes
okay i'm giving you the rates
okay let me just-
yes uh it is very simple to take the uh mrt
yes there are uh signs are all written in english
so it's actually very easy to get by
uh we have just uh a few line alright at the east-west line and of course the reverse direction that is the green colour line
uh and uh north-east line uh that would be a purple colour
and a second line that is in yellow
yes
so uh and of course it always go in reverse direction yah
so very easy to take the uh subway our mrt
yes
okay our mrt is charge as well based on uh distance travel
okay our mrt is charge as well based on uh distance travel
so let's say if you're in the east you want to travel down to let say orchard road that would be a cost of uh approximately about two dollars
uh yah so you- since you're only going to spend like two days i would just recommend you to buy uh like the standard ticket
uh no you just buy like a per trip basis
uh we have like uh not the one day pass uh but we have like a tourist pass
yes
okay so yah ea~ your earlier question like how much does it cost in science nine dollars uh for- yes nine dollars the admission
yes
yah
yah and of course we do have like a four d kind of a show
uh again it depends on what show it's gonna show in august
uh that's like in a three hundred sixty degrees kind of facility theatre
uh no that's an additional of ten dollars
yah
but there is option huh whether you want to see this show or not
otherwise uh-
yah
yes correct
uh no normally our hotels would include the breakfast
correct
so like for if you're spending the whole day on sentosa island uh or in universal studio there are meals there are dining options available out there
okay so you could have like a just simple meal um like a sandwich or something in the park
and for dinner options uh because uh you'll be spending uh quite a fair amount on your hotel stay
uh yes we do have a food court uh located on sentosa island
uh for a meal with drink let's say a main course with a drink that would cost you approximately about ten dollars
per person
yah ten singapore dollars per person
yah ten singapore dollars per person
yes so you can have like uh fried hokkien noodles uh a fried carrot cake alright satay
yes fried carrot cake
ah okay yah
our fried be~ uh carrot cake version is very different from uh the american fried uh carrot cake or the european versions
our fried be~ uh carrot cake version is very different from uh the american fried uh carrot cake or the european versions
uh this is a savoury uh kind of egg with white radish
yes it's actually white radish that has been grated uh and with rice flour
so it's cooked like a little bit- some of them cook it like pancake style
yah it's actually quite filling yah
so that is something that is uh i think not found in your country
so you may want to try that
challenging okay eating with your hands would be like either the chili crabs or uh pepper crabs this will be challenging
challenging okay eating with your hands would be like either the chili crabs or uh pepper crabs this will be challenging
yes
but again not many um uh not many uh food court will offer this option
so you would be able to find them in chinatown for this particular dish
uh we do have- from the street food i think it will be like satay at uh at the satay club over at old uh lau pa sat
uh we do have- from the street food i think it will be like satay at uh at the satay club over at old uh lau pa sat
satay is marinated meat uh cooked- uh pierced with skewers and it's cooked over charcoal

okay the fast food that is available here would ranges from mcdonalds uh mcdonalds right up to wendy's kfc
okay so yah
this would be some of the uh fast food that we have here
yes
uh yes
yah
yah this is what i'm going to show you is claypot rice
yah okay
it's a rice cooked in a claypot so you get this aroma and of course uh most of the time uh they have either- you can ask for seafood or chinese sausage or chicken uh um in this dish alright
it's a rice cooked in a claypot so you get this aroma and of course uh most of the time uh they have either- you can ask for seafood or chinese sausage or chicken uh um in this dish alright

uh average temperature in the afternoon uh ranges from about thirty degrees to thirty two degrees uh any time of the year

uh in the mor~ in the evening from let say eight o'clock onwards uh the temperature will go down to twenty six degrees right up to the morning uh about seven o'clock in the morning
yah so we don't have drastic change of temperature
yes
ah okay
this bugis remember earlier on i also introduce to uh like a no brand kind of a shopping
alright so in all our shopping centre there's always uh air-conditioned food court
uh but the bugis one it's open air so you can- of course try this food it is sold in either uh air-condition food centre or non-air-conditioned food centre
so let say you could get it for four dollars and if you're going to have uh your- the same kind of food in air-condition uh food centre then you pay about six dollars
so let say you could get it for four dollars and if you're going to have uh your- the same kind of food in air-condition uh food centre then you pay about six dollars

yah
okay
so- three-star you say
then you have a lot of money left over for only a thousand dollars
huh
yes
just a minute
the hotels would all have air conditioning in singapore
and uh what you want is attached bathroom and you want a fridge
uh we also have uh okay we have a list here
alright
a good view
okay
i've got you this hotel
it's called gallery hotel
are you getting it on your screen
can you see the picture at the top
uh that's the view
you're looking at singapore river
and that's part of the theatres on the bay
uh you can't quite see here
but on the right side of that picture uh some of the tall buildings in the business district
so it's really a nice view
oh yes
can you see
it is a sort of art piece with the different colours
and it's right by the singapore river
so if you like to walk around in the evenings or even early morning it's a very nice place
let me see here
let's see the facilities that they have
you've got internet interactive
uh connectivity
yes
you have tv with remote cable
tea and coffee making facility hair dryer
bathroom amenities
they even give you your own bathrobe and bedroom slippers
and you can get a laptop workstation
pardon
they should have
okay i'm looking for more images here
you actually very near to chinatown across the river
have meals there
yes safe
very safe
you have the swimming pool
i think this is the dining area the middle picture
so it's very good class
i don't know why they call themselves three-star
the lobby is here
it's not big in size
but it's in a good location
yes and it~ let me see uh-
you see okay
do you see the room view now
yah
o~ okay
uh wait
did you ask me for the rate just now
and you were asking me about the mer~ um about uh the places around
do you see the picture of what looks like a lion there
that is also within walking uh distance from your hotel
uh you walk along the river and uh you will reach it in no time
and behind is a first class hotel the fullerton hotel
and there's also a museum nearby
so i'm waiting for the rates to appear right now
because in case you come by yourself you know um these places are within walking distance
it's also the historic area uh with many colonial buildings from the time when we were under the british
and-
bring your camera and take lots of photos
uh just-
let me- just now the room rates
just a minute huh
alright
so-
just have a look at your room rates first
it say single with breakfast is two two seven
it say single with breakfast is two two seven
twin with breakfast is also two two seven
twin with breakfast is also two two seven
yes one night
that's- that-
okay
now you were asking me about- uh what was your next question
okay
let me get to the mass rapid transit
is it- without much hassle i would say take-
no you wouldn't get lost because the signage is very good
and at the station when you arrive at the airport you will get a help from the station master or the officer uh at the station
so-
so let me show you where you are
this is the map of the southern part of singapore
and if you- are you getting the map
can you see on the right-hand side number three in green
that is where the airport is
so if you go down to the basement when you arrive and buy a transit ticket i'll tell you more about it later
uh first you change some money and then you buy your transit ticket with a card
and uh you can use the card you top it up with money and use the card
before you go back you provide time to get a refund on the unused portion
they just hold back a little bit for the manufacture of the card
they just hold back a little bit for the manufacture of the card
okay you travel along the green line
and you come to the- let me see
you go down to outram park
can you see the purple line
where the green hits the purple right at the bottom
so you switch to the north line and you are at chinatown
and-
clarke quay is where you get off and you have to- you may have to walk across the river
the bridges across the river
but it's very nice
it's very pleasant walk
i've done it just for fun myself
yes that's- yes
so and- yes there's a train station there in the basement
and you can see it branching off right
so what they have done is they have split it so that you have to take it only to tanah merah and then you take the westbound line
you make sure you switch on the westbound or else you'll end up in another part of town called pasir ris
which is also fun
is a holiday area it's near the sea
oh um yes that would be okay
uh but the signs are very clear
and if you ask anybody there most of them are working at the airport
they will direct you to the right direction
okay
uh you don't want to try like at the market or um you don't want to- so is your stomach delicate or-
shrimps and crabs are quite expensive
they are not so cheap in singapore uh because singaporeans love it
so if you go the food courts in the singapore you- the good thing is you can actually see what you are eating
yah because they cook right in front of you
okay
uh then i suggest you eat near your hotel since you don't have much time
uh i believe that for lunch they were having a fifteen dollar promotion
i have noticed that all the restaurants were having that promotion so you could have your choice of italian western asian uh that's for lunch
dinner it's a different story because that is a nice place to be at
so the dinner prices go up quite a bit
so the dinner prices go up quite a bit
and-
yah
uh no usually it's a set meal
and they stipulate what you are eating
and they stipulate what you are eating
so um you are sort of told exactly what you are going to eat exist
something that you might want to try in singapore
we've got these restaurants here
uh but they are uh not in your location
but i'm trying to look for a dish
okay
okay
okay this place is good
it's called crystal jade and it's at holland
uh holland uh is not name after the country it's named after an architect
uh you can take the train and uh you will uh end-up at holland just nearby and you can just walk here
and this place is called crystal jade
they have a chain of restaurants all over
but holland has got uh nice ambiance also so you might want to walk around there
yes it's nice it's simple but it's nice
it's not posh so it won't break your bank
but it serves uh better than average chinese food i think
uh do you know this dish xiao long bao
uh do you know this dish xiao long bao
it is a little dumpling
yah steamed and it's actually got a bit of soup inside the dumpling which is unusual
so you see the prices here
spending twenty one dollars to thirty dollars
okay a cheap meal at the food centre uh simple noodles would be only three dollars
so if you have two plates six dollars
so if you have two plates six dollars
so this is more expensive than that
so this is more expensive than that
yah
if you want indian food
wait let me get you-
yes uh-
there's a place- there's a place called race course road in singapore
located where there used to be a real race course in the early days
and there are full of indian restaurants there
okay i'm just gonna go-
race course road restaurants in singapore
okay
so here we have a list of them
uh on the northeast line uh there's a stop right at little india
so when you get off the train station you just walk
and~ yes that is right
banana leaf i go there myself
um banana leaf means you actually eat off a clean banana leaf
uh is- the food is good
it's also hot if you like hot food
but you see here they have north indian and they have south indian
so if you don't go for too much hot food you can go for the north indian
yes
chili hot
and the north indian is milder
is got spices but it is not so burning on the tongue
and we have something called fish head curry
have you- heard of it
they got- they get the head of a big fish and they cook curry with uh tomato and lady's fingers and a little bit of tamarind so it's slightly sourish
chewy what do you call it
ch~ chewy junior let me see
oh!
uh no but we have similar things
there do you see junior- but i got it here junior singapore
yes chewy junior singapore
now i'm learning something from you
yah the bugis is uh one of the stops of on the east-west line
say vanilla cream cream puffs doughnuts
yes and uh-
it's in this bugis area right across the road
you can see there's a small lane and they have lots of little stalls on either side
so if you are looking-
a bit more organised than a flea market
and- the train station is called bugis
yes but they are no longer you know
yes but they are no longer you know
so this is like a major shopping area there are offices there as well
yes you can buy lots of things
at bugis there is a big shopping centre uh it's called bhg
it stands for be here for good
because they took over the store from another store that closed
so i'm not joking
but the~ nobody knows- i mean not- very few people bother what is about
so you gotta look for bhg and it's at the bugis station
and like i said across the road where that little alley is the bugis lane you can look for lots of funky clothes you might like them
uh t-shirts and things shoes
yes you can buy a lot of things there
yes you can buy a lot of things there
there you-
you can get them there
and also walk to chinatown from your hotel

just a minute

it's called the theatres on the bay

there are two major theatres and smaller studios
let me get it the ticketing
during the indian festival time they have indian musicians coming and indian concerts
so you're talking about show i'll go to the theatres on the bay and see if i can- a calendar
uh magic shows-
ah okay
ther~ okay just give me a moment to get back there
i'm trying to get to their programme section
uh it depends on the type of show
if it's an international artist you are watching then it's expensive
but if it's uh something not so- somebody not so well-known or high profile then it's a little bit better
just let me-
because you are staying one day and it is a bit limited
yah you know
i think five days is good
yes then you go- uh we have good shows at marina bay sands that's where one of the casinos is
uh but-
you know the casino theatre
okay
uh you don't have to gamble there if you are just seeing the show
if you like heritage then little india and uh chinatown uh to walk around it's very exciting
and then to try some of the local food
yes and walk down the river towards the bay where the merlion is
it's a- it is a symbol for the singapore tourism board originally uh because a prince that came to singapore thought he saw an animal and he was wondering what it was
and someone told him it's a lion
and someone told him it's a lion
but we have no lions in singapore
but we have no lions in singapore
no records of lions
no records of lions
so we think he saw perhaps a tiger or a big deer and because we are a uh you know we are an island and we were a fishing village and now we are an international sea port so we have the mer for mermaid and for the sea
so we think he saw perhaps a tiger or a big deer and because we are a uh you know we are an island and we were a fishing village and now we are an international sea port so we have the mer for mermaid and for the sea
and then the lion for the what the prince thought he saw
and then the lion for the what the prince thought he saw
so we have the top and the bottom joined together
and-
okay you see- do you see the singapore river
so your hotel is nearby here where you see river valley road on the top left
okay in that vicinity is your hotel
it's a very pleasant walk down the river and you can- cross the road and get on to the north side
you will be passing bars and eating places along the way
and you can take lots of photos of yourself
right on the edge is the merlion park
sorry again

renting a house for one day uh i am not sure
but you can rent a room in uh places that's uh are for expats settling into singapore
do you know what i mean
uh huh
uh yah you having a cough huh
i'm glad
i hope you will think about staying five days and not just one day
okay
uh huh

how can i help you euke
okay fourth to the sixth of april
uh may i know are you both in your twenties or thirties
uh what is your budget for coming
uh what is your budget for coming
is that for both of you or for just-
for yourself uh-
so do you mind if you go to a budget hotel
and you can take public transport around singapore
we have got very good uh transportation system by rail
mass rapid transit and also by buses
uh they're all air conditioned
so your thousand dollars could uh very well uh be enough for the both of you
it's just for the land arrangement right
are you able to from where you are
yes that's right
okay
i'm on the cebu pacific website now or rather i'm trying to get on to it
uh it would be a round trip ticket
it's origin would be- is it manila
manila and your destination is singapore
and departure date is the fourth of april
and departure date is the fourth of april
okay
yah
okay just give me a moment
i'm a catholic
i'm a catholic
is it- are you too
many of my filipino friends are
oh there are plenty
in fact uh ninety per cent of our choir members are catholic
oh
so we depend on them to sing for us
uh okay
and you can come to singapore from there
uh you- there are
you can but you know you have a limited budget
if you get a guide to pick you up and send you to town by limousine and all that it will be expensive
it's very easy to do a free and easy uh by yourself when you arrived
but let- yes you can be picked up from the airport
you can do all your tours privately
uh but let me get back to your uh question about the fare
you see it there
april the fourth on your screen
cebu pacific air
from manila to singapore
so those are all the flights
um the promotional fares are not available but i can see here six thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars
uh for filipino peso i don't know how that got uh how that connects
uh what's the-
yes um
for the fare
uh what part of singapore are you think- what are your interests
okay
we have only one zoo in singapore
and it's part of an organisation-
called uh wildlife reserves
so- yes that's right
and you can visit the zoo in the day
and then walk to the night safari which is just next door
and you can visit the night safari to see the nocturnal animals
let me get on their website huh
just a minute
uh if you buy a ticket for all the attractions it's much cheaper
okay
uh it's uh it depends on where you stay
you'll be able to visit a lot of places
yes you can get hotels about a hundred over dollars
you can get hotels at a thousand over dollars
so-
and uh if you don't take the taxis and you don't hire a private guide then you use public transport you save a lot of money
you haven't been around- you haven't been to singapore before right
so normally we do a city tour where we bring you to the ethnic areas
uh like chinatown little india
and the malay quarter if you like where we have an old mosque
and the malay quarter if you like where we have an old mosque
and these are the heritage areas where the buildings are conserved for future generations to enjoy
and these are the heritage areas where the buildings are conserved for future generations to enjoy
we would also bring you to the historic area by the singapore river
we would also bring you to the historic area by the singapore river
and you can in fact take a riverboat ride in the bay
it's very scenic and it's very good for photography
it's very scenic and it's very good for photography
so on the tour we would tell you things about singapore like the population
uh that we have a mixed culture of chinese malays and indians we have
buddhist christians oh
yes i think it's only in the airport that it is uh restricted
yes i think it's only in the airport that it is uh restricted
uh so usually you can take pictures
it's just that if you are in a place of worship like a temple or a mosque um it's better to ask for permission from somebody who seems to be in charge
it's just that if you are in a place of worship like a temple or a mosque um it's better to ask for permission from somebody who seems to be in charge
uh usually we don't take pictures of people who are praying but of the architecture
uh i beg your pardon
uh okay
uh do's or don'ts um generally you don't smoke where there's a non-smoking area like in the restaurant
they have only a certain part of the place where you can smoke
de~ there's a designated area and it says that you can smoke
so it's limited to a very small percentage of the total area of the restaurant
but you can't use- if you hired a car you can't use your phone and uh drive at the same time
you know what i mean
i think it's more fine
yah
uh i say get a train pass and then google for places when you're in singapore and pick up the tourist brochures on arrival when you are at the airport
uh i say get a train pass and then google for places when you're in singapore and pick up the tourist brochures on arrival when you are at the airport
so that even if you don't have a computer you can look at the brochures and you can have a quick look at what you like and don't like
and then we have uh people at the airport that can tell you how you can get there
uh if that will save you a lot of money because you don't have to hire a cab
you don't have to actually hire me as a guide
or private car because hiring someone privately will cost you more money
you- uh you can plan it also before you go
let me try and get these parks for you
it was a bit slow downloading
yah
uh huh
i think it's about forty five dollars or forty dollars that you can pay to visit the bird park or the zoo and the night safari
i think it's about forty five dollars or forty dollars that you can pay to visit the bird park or the zoo and the night safari
yes that's right
but you see the three in one special there
it's fifty eight dollars and you visit all three
yah
you-
the night safari and the zoo are located next to each other
and you just walk across the car park
so you can visit the zoo in the afternoon
yes and then walk across the night safari
and then if you're energetic and you want to have one whole day for something else-
but eh could you speak a bit louder please
alright uh-
uh huh
uh huh
uh i can't hear you
afternoon to the zoo and the night safari in the evening
afternoon to the zoo and the night safari in the evening
is that right
uh okay i lose you now and then
but-
yes okay
i'm getting you now
uh i sugg~ okay
uh normally i think you have a month to use it up
but you can use it up within a day it's not a problem
uh if you are tired by the time you reached the night safari or the zoo you can take a tram ride
but it's really nice to walk around these places
and you just have to remember to keep your three in one ticket the minute you buy it
uh huh
uh huh
uh i'm losing you
oh you're okay you are back
yes
uh actually if you are going to walk from the zoo to the night safari you will have a limited choice of places to eat you-
you will have a limited choice of places to eat you- i suggest you eat inside the night safari
restaurants
yes then
yes there are restaurants and there are like burger places if you don't want to eat a full meal
yes you are allowed to do it
uh we have also fast food outside so if you want to buy and-
while you're walking around the zoo you nibble on the food it's fine
it's fine it's not a problem
uh it's just that you should be aware that you shouldn't leave litter around
you should try and keep our places clean and usually people do adhere to that rule
uh so that you are mindful and there will be lots of bins around for you
uh well one of the cleanest cities
you want to go to the beach
i think one of the nicest beaches is on sentosa
it is an island
siloso means jealous right or jealousy
siloso means jealous right or jealousy
jealousy yah
uh i see
we are not sure how that name came about
uh but we do have uh very good views here i'll show you of the beach
there you go
that's all
yeah
yes very good
yes very good
uh and the- you know it's safe
it is uh-
yes indeed it is very romantic
and uh you can also stay until the night time
we have bus-
and restaurants there
and another dollar for public bus
yes
and one dollar if you take the public bus in which i suspect you will need to after on your visit to all the parks you'll be a bit tired
free yes it's free
oh- we don't have a cottage
we usually just set up a place underneath the coconut tree or uh some people even just-
uh hang out at where the food places are
uh hang out at where the food places are
yes because we- it's you know it's very open
so we try and hide under the shelter of some trees
yah there are resort hotels there
but usually for the resort hotels you stay in the hotels-
you would have to stay at the hotels
uh that would burst your budget a little bit
uh yes
the hotels are a few hundred dollars
uh then you might want to stay at the nice hotels there and you can just come out and swim
uh yes i mean if you're checking in to the hotels you are staying at the hotels on sentosa
you are staying on the island in the hotels
books you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books
books you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books
uh did you say museum uh on books
did i hear books
is that right huh
okay
so these are the hotels that are available on the ho~ on the island so that's quite different from a budget hotel
let me- let me try to get it for you huh
april- the fourth
on the fourth you're coming in
right
on the fourth
is that- sorry i thought it's the fourth
it's the fifth is it
no but if you want to stay at the hotel don't you want to stay- you mean you want to change hotels
no but if you want to stay at the hotel don't you want to stay- you mean you want to change hotels
so the fourth is the first day then
alright
and uh you are departing on the
sixth huh
okay
so let's see if it's available first
you may not want to go anywhere once you stay in this hotel
yes that's right
so okay these are the rates at the moment
which is actually quite attractive five hundred and seventy dollars
which is actually quite attractive five hundred and seventy dollars
so it's two eight five a day
oh
oh it's-
yah it's affordable
yah it's affordable
yes correct
it's affordable
it's affordable
for a resort hotel i think it's very affordable
and you wanted a museum right
i give you one of our nice museums
uh it's the asian civilisations museum
we- well we have been- for years uh thought of as a- just a fishing village until the british came-
uh in 1819
and uh we became a colony until 1942 when the japanese arrived and occupied singapore until 1945
so we do have an earlier history that we are not very uh familiar with because of the lack of written history
um chicken rice is quite famous
it's the rice- the chicken is cooked in- boiled in soup
and some of the- or rather the water of the soup for boiling the chicken is used for cooking the rice
and a little bit of oil is added
so the rice is fragrant and it's oily and we put in the pandan's leaf
i think you're familiar with that
it has a- nice fragrance
uh he cooks the chicken and then he cook- he takes out the chicken and he cooks the rice separately uh with the stock that he's used to cook the chicken
so you-
yes there is-
and there are some restaurants that you give uh grated ginger
and chili
the chili has got vinegar
so maybe not if you're with your girlfriend it might be a bit stinky after that
uh there are restaurants
uh a place called east coast road
and if you come on uh saturday sunday uh most filipinos are at the place called lucky plaza
but i wouldn't categorise them as being restaurants
uh because they are more the filipino people so it's quite affordable prices
these places they are i think owned by filipinos and uh it's just that they're not high-end you get what i mean
yes
very good food um filipino food
oh
so- wait
uh wait
like we have textiles do you see here
that's up to june so it will be here when you are here
and we have tank shipwreck gold and ceramic you see what i mean
yes
the ones you see here are special exhibitions that are here for a short period only so they're very special
uh so i-
yes
yes you can
it's- uh there is one with art and craft from sarawak jewellery uh and uh bas~ woven clothings that the villagers used to make
uh part of the exhibit is on loan from a collector who went into the jungle and bought up the items
that's one of my favourite places also
and we have another museum this one is called peranakan
uh this is an exceptional culture
it's a mix of chinese and malay
uh no i'm married
oh we sometimes walk along the bay you know by the singapore river
and then we stop and have a sandwich or have ice cream
there are lots of joints along the singapore river
so it's very relaxing
uh hm uh huh
huh uh yes
uh you could visit the earlier museum-
museum i told you the asian civilisations museum
that is-
so- yes
uh so if you have time and you want to squeeze in two museums i suggest you go to the peranakan and then the asian civilisations
and then in the evening you could walk by the river
asian civilisations
the one where you see the tank exhibits
when you come out of the museum you're looking at the river
yes that's right
and you can also see the merlion but the merlion is crowded with tourists so if you walk the other way uh you cross the river you walk down there
the merlion is the emblem of singapore uh tourism
the merlion is the emblem of singapore uh tourism
uh that's the- that's right
the one that's half-fishtail and half-lion's head
that's at the mouth of the river
yes that's right
uh that's also a nice place to walk it's just that it's not very quiet
uh lovely views that are very uh attractive for courting couples
i often see a lot of them there
oh
the finest restaurants
you could go to the uh swissotel the stamford
okay
and it's also within the area you go to the top of the hotel
yah the stamford
it's used to be called the westin stamford
and right at the top where you get very good views
it's a restaurant
you could also stay there if you wanted to
okay if you look at the map here
can you see the map
uh where you see this dot is the hotel
and your museum is just a little bit further down
that's the bay
uh the little blue patch on your right
pardon
yes that's right
so let me see if they have the hotel- the restaurant here
uh taxi fare you mean from where
to
oh uh which hotel did you say you wanted to stay at
the hotel would ac~
um i'm not sure if they stop you right there but where this- where swissotel is uh they have- you see- can you see the restaurant now on your screen
yah
yes lovely isn't it
so-
they may if you ask the concierge
they might be able to accommodate you
because these are major areas uh for shopping
the shuttle uh to get into the hotel is just one dollar
uh to- into the hotel
i- no i don't think they bring you right to the hotel
you would have to pay extra for the shuttles
the transfer- you're talking about transfer from the hotel right
you are talking about from the hotel when you arrived at the airport
no it will not include
you can get to just across the island at uh harbourfront
yah forty minutes
forty minutes
yes or- yah that's because you have to make a change and i'm uh putting in extra for you asking for directions and all that
it would be less than one hour
yes you will go very far because you're staying only two nights
uh but uh-
uh you might have to top-up a bit for your expensive dinner
um yeah
yes it's enough
yes it's more than enough
yes
and-
yes
for tour attractions it's a little over forty dollars i think
for tour attractions it's a little over forty dollars i think
you go on the next day in the morning free and easy after you wake up
uh no it's not for free
you will have to pay uh it depends if there is a special exhibit on i believe it's eight dollars or so
so it's still very cheap
if you're a senior citizen you get a lot of discounts but you're not
oh no it's okay
yes
no not much
uh if you hire my services you have to pay for my services
uh if you hire my services you have to pay for my services
but like i said you could uh easily find your way to the airport and just check in
it's- well singapore is very safe you don't really need uh for a departure
for a guide
yes you can but of course you can also hire the services of a guide
because of the euke
i know
you don't sound japanese
i really hope to see you with your girlfriend in singapore
thank you

okay
walking from one place to another
okay
so commercial district meaning um more towards the shopping belt rather than the business district right
so commercial district meaning um more towards the shopping belt rather than the business district right
okay
um there are some interesting hotels there
okay uh one of the hotels that i would be able to recommend you uh would be the rendezvous hotel
yah
okay we are looking approximately about just slightly over two hundred dollars
yes it is
otherwise there is another hotel uh call the grand park hotel
slightly below two hundred a night
uh yes uh a standard room
a standard room uh for one room
alright yah so this is the price range uh for the hotel
okay uh in this hotel itself uh they have a restaurant
okay they have a restaurant in this particular hotel
okay they have a restaurant in this particular hotel
and yes they do serve some of our cuisine
otherwise i would also recommend to you uh just about ten minutes' walk from the rendezvous hotel um you'll be able to get to one fullerton
yes and there is a restaurant there that serve a unique singapore uh food
yes and there is a restaurant there that serve a unique singapore uh food
yah so uh there is a seafood restaurant
and of course a lot of people including the locals like to eat uh chili crab
yes
oh what other delicacy is it
okay because we are multiracial here so we do have like the malay cuisine uh the chinese the indian
and we have another uh food that is also a favourite of a lot people is called peranakan food
food
yes
it's in-short it will be a chinese style of cooking uh but using uh more malay uh spices
uh i wouldn't say most singapore uh food are spicy it's these are just different cuisines uh that we have in singapore
so yes but yes a lot of uh singapore people like to eat spicy food
yes
to-
from the hotel
from rendezvous hotel you can uh walk to- or i would say either you walk or you take this mrt train from uh city hall and you alight at raffles place mrt
you will be alighting and walking just above five minutes to the uh marina bay
okay it's a beautiful bay
um you will be able to see uh the bay front which is very pretty
uh and of course the marina bay sands resort as well as the icon of singapore we call it the merlion park
uh the merlion is the uh ti~ uh lion head with a fish tail
okay so that is the um good photo uh stops uh for you to take some memories of singapore
so you can do that just walking distance
so i would think uh taking the train would be a better idea
uh would you want to see uh just tourist sports
uh would you want to see uh just tourist sports
okay
uh okay in around the merli~ uh the marina bay uh it's also a wa~ a nice walk because uh you are just walking around the bay front
uh like i said it has interesting skyline there are some interesting sculptures uh along the marina bay area
uh like i said it has interesting skyline there are some interesting sculptures uh along the marina bay area
uh and in the night time uh we do have a show that is um you don't have to pay for this show at the marina bay front
uh it's a laser water show uh on the marina bay itself
uh it's a laser water show uh on the marina bay itself
but that only comes on in the night time
but that only comes on in the night time
and there is a very interesting museum on marina bay as well it's called the arts and science museum
arts and science museum uh in the marina bay okay so-
uh it is actually just next door
the um building itself is shaped like a lotus flower
okay now i'm showing you uh how this arts and science museum looks like
it shaped like uh a lotus flower
okay this is the arts and science uh museum
so everything dedicated to arts and science and of course at certain time uh eh we have special exhibit alright
the last exhibit was the uh titanic exhibition
and this is actually a world-class exhibition
and earlier on you mention uh you also want to do the zoo as well right
and earlier on you mention uh you also want to do the zoo as well right
uh approximately about twenty kilometres
you take the north line and you alight at uh ang mo kio station
and from there uh you would take a bus to go
you will go- yah yes and you take a bus to the uh zoo
yes this is open in the daytime
okay
uh the park actually opens at eight am in the morning
yes this is the singapore zoo and you will see uh mammals in this zoo
yes this is the singapore zoo and you will see uh mammals in this zoo
alright so uh like i said uh lots of uh is- we have the largest collection of the orang-utans
uh there is a show in the zoo uh that you can watch
uh no it goes on every day
alright every day we have this show
uh in the morning uh it will be eleven o'clock
and in the afternoon it will be four pm
yes so this is the uh show which is interesting alright
yes so this is the uh show which is interesting alright
but our show is not like the circus kind of show
it just uh shows you yah what the animals uh do alright uh in the wild as well uh what they do
you will buy your ticket from the mrt train station
we would have a ticket a few ticket machines
and uh you will they will tell you where- which location you are now at and you just tell them- you just press the button which destination you are going to stop and the machine will tell you how much to uh- uh how much is the fare
uh you just have to use singapore money to purchase your ticket
the machine will als~ yes so it all depends on uh where you're taking from and where you are going to stop
per person
yes
okay beyond the vicinity of the hotel of course there are shopping areas on orchard road uh and then you walk to the merlion park or you take the mrt
uh otherwise you can uh walk to the museum we have the national museum out there the uh singapore arts museum
or do you want to consider doing ethnic places in singapore
uh which ethnic place do you want me to recommend
uh which ethnic place do you want me to recommend
uh which ethnic place would you want me to recommend
is it-
okay uh would i be able to introduce uh you uh to the indian quarters
a traditional indian place where the indians when they came to singapore most of them live in this area
so we have preserved this area and we call it little india
yes
so we have another area called chinatown
and uh this other place would be called little india
and there is another malay area call kampong glam
yah
uh well the malays in singapore of course uh the- some of them were native in singapore
uh but our- some of the malay ancestors came from the nearby uh countries of malaysia as well as indonesia
so we would call eh and of course uh yah the nearby islands
generally we call this area the malay archipelo
yes so uh but of course the people here who are malay and if they are locals here they would have been born here
their ancestors will probably come from the nearby countries for the malays
uh sorry i don't understand you
okay there is uh hotel called uh the link hotel
i- l i n k and it is located in uh a residential area a very old residential area uh call tiong bahru
it is also a very accessible location because there is the mrt uh that is located um just about less than ten minutes' walk to the mrt
yes about ten minutes' walk from this hotel
yes about ten minutes' walk from this hotel
the first photograph of the front facade of the hotel uh this was originally residential area
uh it's a building that is originally residential but they have now been converted to a hotel
okay the attractions near to this hotel like i mention uh this is in a residential area
so you would be um going to a market alright that opens in the morning from uh seven thirty to twelve o'clock
uh they will sell fish meat fruits vegetable in this market sold
and you will be meeting a lot of local people uh when you visit the market
so it's something i would say interesting uh because these are not the normal uh tourist site
so you get- when you stay in this hotel you get to interact with a lot of the local because majority of the people that you meet uh around your hotel area would be local
uh i wouldn't say it's not the normal tourist belt you know
uh i wouldn't say it's not the normal tourist belt you know
because you are uh located in an area uh that is very much residential
but this a nice uh boutique hotel
okay uh the rates uh of course again it depending sometimes they do have promotions uh in uh certain uh during certain dates
alright but it should be in the range of about two hundred uh dollars
per day meaning uh from let say today it's starts at two o'clock or three o'clock to the next day uh check out eleven or twelve o'clock the next day
yes so uh again we have to see whether let say if you're going to arrive
april
april the ten
okay right
we were going to have two adults and one kid
alright let see
is there any promotions for this particular period
okay this rate is not available here
yes
would you be able to make it for this date
hotel singapore
so like the promotion oh yes they have- oh no that is the set meal promo for that period of time in may
uh yah for the month of may
okay and uh we have something quite interesting out there
uh over the weekend a lot of people uh would be bringing out their birds
the owners-
yah so and they will-
yah the birds yes
so uh the owners will just have a chit chatting session with their friends
and the birds gets to meet their friends as well
so it's something a little bit unusual
uh again you don't see in the mainstream kind of uh tourist area but you get to see this in our housing state
or residential area
okay
yes it's a different experience for uh the bird corners
yes it's a different experience for uh the bird corners
and uh also uh the market you know pay a visit to our market
again it's a different experience altogether
so you can have your breakfast over there you can have lunch or you can have dinner
uh then i would recommend that you stay right in the heart of orchard road
uh because in december we light up the whole street of orchard road to the marina uh area
so the street looks uh like a wonderland
uh and the buildings the hotels will be also specially decorated for christmas
so it's wonderful time to visit in december
okay you can stay at the elizabeth hotel
that is just ten minutes' walk up to the orchard road area
okay elizabeth hotel
yah
again it's not like uh that big a hotel
and it's-
yes the rates are still affordable
okay it still in the price range of about two hundred
but it is a nice uh small hotel uh not that big hotel and it just walk ten minutes or less uh to the main uh orchard road shopping area
okay so this is the elizabeth hotel and do you want me to show you uh the christmas time how does the street look like
okay this is how uh the street uh looks like
yes you can it's just uh a walk of about ten minutes and you are in uh orchard road
yes
so it's also uh interesting place uh to stay and you can see this is the last year the christmas light-up in orchard road
it looks like a christmas wonderland isn't it
so uh this year two zero one two would be different from last year
so last year would be uh all the uh winter kind of uh feeling
uh this year will be different theme and it's- the light up stretches from the beginning of orchard road right up to the marina area
uh it's a pretty long stretch of road that is lighted up
yes just one straight road down
uh orchard road is a pretty straight road all the way down to the marina square
yes
yes correct
uh yes no christmas lights in april
only in december
are you sure you um have uh most of the information that you need
then i would recommend that you spend uh more time uh exploring the area
and of course we have a lot more other interesting museums for example war museums in singapore we have uh nice parks uh wetland parks if you like something and you get wet
and we have recently also open-up in the eastern part of singapore northeast um a very interesting park uh at the uh pasir ris uh area
so these are parks which uh again a lot more locals would be visiting
uh they are usually located right next to the uh river area
uh not all are newly open some are the older ones
uh not all are newly open some are the older ones
sure
yes it's a park uh nice to stroll around in the evening uh morning
uh not just wetland uh you can see this is the town park
uh not just wetland uh you can see this is the town park
okay
uh this is not meant for swimming it's just a park
but it's just a good scenery
lots of greenery
okay so this is uh- and we have interesting parks all over the uh- all over singapore alright
so you could see uh a lot of the areas the residential areas we have one of this park so uh you get to see greenery not just uh buildings and not just shops in singapore
yah this is a map of singapore okay and we have like if you look at the uh parameter uh most of this we have some parks out there
you could see uh the shaded area on the uh right-hand corner
yes correct
yes sure
so we will hope to see you soon

that is in actually the price range of uh hundred and uh a hundred and ten
okay
i don't really want to recommend you the other places in uh geylang area because uh i think it's not so convenient
alright
so maybe a little bit more in terms of your budget um okay
okay
uh they are quite conveniently located where you can take the public transport to your- the places of interest
i would like to recommend um the zoo for him
okay
uh the zoo is located in the northern part of singapore
uh the zoo is located in the northern part of singapore
and uh what he can see in the zoo would be uh all the uh mammals a lot of mammals

uh bus number one three eight
do you know how to take the public transport

for the mrt you pay according to the distance travelled
so you will buy a ticket
uh when you arrived at the station uh in- within the busy areas like the vicinity of the city hall area to the orchard area
uh the mrt runs beneath the road
so you go down to the basement area
and there would be a ticket machine
uh you will have to carry some singapore money with you if you want to take our public transport
uh yes
so you just uh press a button to tell you the- to tell the computer uh the machine which station are you going to alight
alright
uh well uh i would recommend you to change some singapore money
uh well uh i would recommend you to change some singapore money
uh if you are going to take uh public transport
uh in case you want to buy some street food
so i would recommend that you change um money into singapore money
uh are you talking about us dollars
okay from us dollars to singapore dollars uh the rate now is approximately about one singapore dollars will give you approximately uh a dollar uh twenty seven cents us uh- sorry
uh one us dollar would give you approximately about a one dollar twenty seven cents-
singapore money
yah
okay the- i would say- well it's very festive and a lot of people uh are very busy preparing for the festival
i would say it uh will be among our major festival like chinese new year sometime in january
i would say it uh will be among our major festival like chinese new year sometime in january
and also the uh festival that's celebrated by the malays will be hari raya
okay
and also deepavali in november
and uh christmas time in december
so i have put on the screen our public holidays calendar for this year
chinese new year is over now
uh it was celebrated on the twenty third and twenty fourth
so the whole month of january was very busy in chinatown
uh may we have vesak day
alright
uh no major preparation before vesak day
alright
so this will be more um- i would say the major festival where you will see a lot more preparation um and a very carnival festive mood uh just before this public holidays
uh nature as in plants or in birds or fishes
or coral- i mean uh marine life
okay
well i would like to recommend you this uh hill which is at- a very popular hill in singapore for the local as well
alright
this is our tallest hill in singapore
but as- if you are too tired you can always turn around and there will be some small animals that you will see along the way
okay so this is the bukit timah
there's no entrance fee um and it would be better if you either go in the morning or the evening
there's no entrance fee um and it would be better if you either go in the morning or the evening
uh bring water with you and also hat with you
okay
that means if there's no trail do not walk on those trail
so just do the normal walkway and there are also walking trail there will be signs that this is a walking trail
it is uh quite a popular hill
so there will be- usually uh some people that you will meet along the way
it's just not like so quiet that you don't see anybody at all
okay for the bukit nature reserve park uh we don't have any uh restaurants out there but just across the road uh there are quite a few eating places
okay for the bukit nature reserve park uh we don't have any uh restaurants out there but just across the road uh there are quite a few eating places
uh restaurants as well as non-air conditioned uh we call it coffee shops
uh just also uh be careful don't put your food items in plastic bag
put them inside your bag because uh there will be some monkeys on the hill
and they will think that you know your plastic bag would have contained food and they may um disturb you
okay i mentioned earlier on uh i would like to recommend the zoo-
uh for your uh child because uh our zoo is very nice
and it- uh the animals are not keep- are not kept in uh cages
he will get to see or you will get to see elephants orang-utans
he will get to see or you will get to see elephants orang-utans
uh in fact singapore zoo has the largest collection of orang-utan
uh that can be found in the zoo
uh yes
uh well i would say that you have to be selective
then you can do a three hours tour of the zoo
or you can do at morning the bukit timah hill and have a lunch in uh one of our local non-air conditioned to the zoo
and in lunch time you can actually do a relaxing river cruise on the singapore river
okay so i will just show you uh the river cruise
uh just a short ride on the singapore river
so that will be something quite relaxing
on this kind of river cruise it's about a half an hour cruise
and you could alight at the- this is the uh the clarke quay area or boat quay area and have a nice dinner
uh no on the cruise itself there's no food provided
so it's just half an hour ride
and there will be a commentary uh on the cruise itself to tell you what you are looking at on the left and right-hand side of the uh places that you're going to pass by
alright
the cruise- yes this is the cruise that i'm talking about
it's a chinese looking kind of a boat
okay
the cruise like i mentioned is only a half an hour ride
the cruise like i mentioned is only a half an hour ride
uh you will pass by some of the highlight the financial district area
uh so you see a lot of skyscrapers
and uh you will see uh bridges
alright old bridges in singapore
and you will also get to see uh- you will also get to see uh the old warehouses
um and of course the icon of singapore the merlion
okay
so it's just a short cruise
okay this is actually the singapore river
okay this is actually the singapore river
okay so you will be travelling out this way out to the marina bay
okay
now i'm gonna just show you this picture here
okay now you can see
alright
so this is the boat that's going to uh travel on the singapore river you're going to see uh this scene
okay
uh now the houses that's yellow in colour uh that is actually clarke quay
so i'm saying that when the boat gets stopped back you can go for a dinner a nice dinner
whether you choose to have a fine dining or casual place cafe there are all uh kind of food there including spanish mexican indian chinese seafood barbecue
they're all found there
alright
so this is what you're going to see uh on the cruise itself
oh
our language of administration here is english so our street sign uh will be english
our language of administration here is english so our street sign uh will be english
all our documents will be english
the menu um given to you by the restaurants will also be written in english
all service staff will be speaking english
uh for one day
okay this is the programme that i would say uh it has something for your son to do
as well as uh a little bit of relaxing cruise in the night time
for example we have universal studio in sentosa
uh you could also do that instead of doing the zoo
um in the afternoon you could go over to sentosa and do universal studio in the afternoon
okay
the highlight i think uh that will be different
there are other uh stu- uh universal studios do not have would be the latest ride it's called transformer
okay
so this is quite an exciting ride uh for you and your son
so this is quite an exciting ride uh for you and your son
yah this is the ride that i'm talking about
so there are seven zones uh to explore in universal uh studio
you can see there's hollywood new york sci-fi ancient egypt and lost world and far far away and madagascar
alright
so these are the seven zone uh that you can visit in universal studio
okay
you can see all these are the scene uh street scene of universal studio
uh alright
i would uh recommend to you uh to bring him to the science centre in singapore
it's um- it will be suitable for a young uh person
okay and- yes
yes the admission charges uh for the science centre uh would be-
nine dollars for an adult and five dollars for the children- for the child
and it is located in the western part of singapore
do you need me to give you direction how to get there
okay
now um i will always come back to city hall mrt-
because this is one of our interchange
uh so because we have not chosen the hotel yet so i will just- for reference go back to city hall
from city hall you take the west line and you alight at jurong east mrt train station
uh what do you say
oh beach
yes we do have beach on the mainland
uh but it is- it will be just a simple beach
and uh- yes
okay i will show you the uh beaches in singapore
uh this is in the east coast so it's just a simple beach
alright
uh it's a little bit rocky over in the uh east coast and also the changi beach uh of singapore
do you want to go there for swimming or- is it for swimming
oh for swimming okay
uh well the changi beach and the east coast beach um will not be fine sand
alright it's a little bit rocky
but uh on saturdays afternoon and sundays afternoon the- you will see more local people going there for swimming
otherwise we have uh better beaches over on sentosa island
otherwise we have uh better beaches over on sentosa island
like uh palawan as well as uh siloso beach over on the sentosa island
uh okay if you intend to extend your holidays in singapore of course like i said there's a lot more things to do
uh okay if you intend to extend your holidays in singapore of course like i said there's a lot more things to do
uh now i'm actually showing you a map of sentosa
but for one day uh you really have to be very selective so we do have other museums in singapore or like the national museum which highlights the uh history of singapore
uh arts museum uh where you see contemporary art
um war museum
okay if your son is interested uh to know a little bit about the war because singapore was occupied by the japanese
uh we do have quite a few war museums as well
um so for visits to museum well depending on how big the museum is
okay
so you seems to be concerned about some rules and regulation with singapore
uh okay
like i said uh we do not encourage littering
um uh so if you does any litter please throw them into the uh litter bins the rubbish bin
uh for lighting of uh cigarette there are quite a few restriction now including the airport
so um in short very simple anything that's indoor in the restaurants yes we do not allow uh cigarettes to be lighted up
uh including bus stop
so there must be uh- like an area uh from the- enclosed area that you can do uh light up of cigarettes
uh yes
so i think these are the major concern otherwise uh crime rate here is pretty low
uh you are able to move around quite freely even in the night time
as usual just avoid all the dark lanes um and do not carry too much cash with you
uh that then you will be having a very enjoyable time in singapore
okay the night safari opens in the night time
from seven thirty to eight o'clock
again it is an open night safari you won't see cages in this night safari
it is just next door to the zoo
at night you could bring him over just next door to the night safari
uh this is a tram that brings you around the night safari
so that you are not too tired
you don' have to walk the entire park
and on this two tram ride itself of course you see about seventy per cent of the animals
it will be different from what you see in the zoo
and if you are not too tired you can do a walk- short walk in the middle of the tram ride there is- the tram will stop you can do a walking trail towards the leopard area
uh that will take you about forty minutes
that will bring you back to the entrance area and you can do another walking trail called the fishing cat trail
alright
so- and if you are not too tired again there is a forest giant trail
again from the entrance area that you can walk
and if you want to see some shows we do have two shows in the night safari
uh but usually there's a long queue to see the creatures of the night show
this is a show it's a-
and they will bring in some animals uh the smaller animals uh for the audience to look at
okay the admission fee for the night safari will be thirty two dollars for the adult
and the child will be twenty one dollars
yes we call our uh ocean park the underwater world
and this is located in um sentosa island
okay the underworld is located on sentosa island
so i'm now flashing you some of the photographs taken in the underwater world
now over here uh the highlight would be- you go into the basement area
you step on the travelator and you were actually in an underground uh tank a very big tank
so inside the travelator you will get to see sharks alright
stingray and lots of other kinds of fishes
uh in this underwater world you don't have to walk
alright the travelator will bring you around
uh you can really get to see a lot of uh marine life when you're in this uh travelator
now besides this travelator if you look at the bottom right-hand corner
these are what we call mimicry
okay
now if this marine- cry- uh marine uh sea creature it's among the seaweeds
you can really miss this marine uh sea creature
alright they actually looks like a seaweed or a plant
yes
but actually if it's among the plant you can't even miss this um uh sea creature
okay so these are just some of the sea marine life that you would see in the underwater world
but this is on sentosa island
so if you're going to choose sentosa then you can do the beach the underwater world and the universal studio all in one day because they're in the same location
uh no because when you come in to singapore our immigration officers uh would normally give you a one month stay in singapore
so there's no need to extend it uh your stay in singapore
but do check on your passport you know what is the validity that's given to you
but i would say normally one month
okay if you forgot alright uh to see what is your length of stay in singapore and you overstayed in singapore then please bring your passport and yourself to our immigration office in lavender uh street
alright we have an immigration uh office there
and tell them uh your situation
alright
for- if you intend to visit the universal studio i will recommend that you book your tickets online first just in case you know that day happens to be a very crowded day because we do have a limit uh as in uh visitors uh going into the universal studio
uh to the universal studio for the adult on a weekday it will be sixty eight dollars
uh weekends public holidays will be seventy four dollars
for the child it will be fifty dollars
and weekend will be uh fifty four uh dollars
uh for certain rides like roller coaster the child would be have- uh to be approximately about uh one point two uh metres tall
okay for certain rides in the park
so i hope you will- you know uh visit us soon
alright

uh so what you want is actually small rooms
uh so what you want is actually small rooms
okay

h o r t short for horticultural
h o r t short for horticultural
uh that is in there a little uh structure that's made of trees that have been formed to look like a little~ very small building
but you can use that little garden area without paying for the room if you are not using the room because you are not inviting all your friends right
but you can use that little garden area without paying for the room if you are not using the room because you are not inviting all your friends right
so i think there will be no charge for that
so i think there will be no charge for that
you just uh go there
you may just have to bear with maybe visitors looking at you
you may just have to bear with maybe visitors looking at you
oh that would be very romantic um-
you have to maybe bring a big umbrella in case it rains
uh when it is you know uh when you have finished proposing and it starts to rain
you just tell her that in singapore we consider rain to be good fortune
because we all need rain don't we
you can take a bus
you can take a bus
and uh you can reach the outside of the park
there are clear signs
and then you walk in and it's very romantic because as you walk in it's uh
and then you walk in and it's very romantic because as you walk in it's uh
the pathway just outside is called the floral walk
the pathway just outside is called the floral walk
so you have flowers and plants
so you have flowers and plants
you can take a lot of photos on your way in
and-
the- uh yes
that's a good idea uh-
until april one
i'm trying to get a fairly nice hotel
but in chinatown we do have boutique hotels that would cost you a bit more
okay um-
i'm just trying to find you a room that can put in an extra bed for your girlfriend's brother
uh the hotels- yah
the hotels in chinatown tend to be rather uh small because they are converted from-
restored shophouses
okay
there is a very good hotel which is actually four or five-star
there is a very good hotel which is actually four or five-star
and the price to me it is quite reasonable
and the price to me it is quite reasonable
uh it's in fact a boutique hotel
uh it's in fact a boutique hotel
it's called hotel nineteen twenty nine
it's called hotel nineteen twenty nine
it is run by a young man who loves taking old buildings and converting them
and- in this one um they have a rooftop garden where you can also propose to her if you like
on the website it's just a little over two hundred dollars
yes
uh they have a suite room
uh and it has a long bath-
uh on the balcony
but i have seen it the bal- the- where the long bath is
it is shielded by plants
and they claimed they have done research where the tall buildings you know they overlook but they can't really see you bathing
uh so it's very unique
uh so you may call it a budget hotel but it's also known as a boutique hotel
uh so you may call it a budget hotel but it's also known as a boutique hotel
so maybe that is the most romantic place for you
so maybe that is the most romantic place for you
so maybe that is the most romantic place for you
i- yes
uh do you see it on your screen
keong saik road in my father's and grandfather's time was a red-light district
okay
um let me get you the mass rapid transit map
souvenirs will be all around
it would be-
uh you would be in chinatown
uh you would be in chinatown
so it's very easy for you
i am getting you the map now
and so since you have quite a nice hotel uh i suggest you come in by train
and use the trains and the buses to move around because many of our buses like ninety nine point nine nine are- per cent are air-conditioned
almost all are air-conditioned now
uh unless the air conditioner uh breaks down
uh and some of them are double-decker buses so you're on uh upper deck you can have a very good view
okay
can you see the map now
can you see on the right-hand side sort of in the middle can you see changi airport at number three
okay
that's where you would start taking your train ride
that's where you would start taking your train ride
so what you do is when you arrived change your money at the airport
and go down to the basement
it's mass rapid transit
that's the name of our rail system
so there you approach the officer and buy a ez-link ticket
wha~ yes
that will allow you to use the buses and trains and you also get a discount uh ins~
and you also get a discount uh ins~ and if you use cash it's a bit more expensive
because uh after you stored value when you return they charge you a small fee for the manufacture of the card but you get your refund back of the unused portion
yes
you buy for all three of you
you will have to buy adult tickets because the thirteen-year-old is not a student in singapore
he's not a young child
he is not you know if he's six or seven you can get a child ticket but he has to get adult ticket
so you take your green line and you follow it down to city hall
so you take your green line and you follow it down to city hall
yes
city hall is uh one of the interchange stations and you- if you like uh on another day you can get off there and have a look around there
but otherwise you continue down to- no let me see
yes
you get off at city hall and you switch to the red line to dhoby ghaut
can you see dhoby ghaut at number eight
yes
uh dhoby ghaut is where three lines meet
can you see
so it's also- yah
so at dhoby ghaut you will just take two stops down to chinatown
e~ it's very fast on the trains
uh maybe forty minutes considering you come in at non peak hours where you wait two minutes more for the train
uh maybe forty minutes considering you come in at non peak hours where you wait two minutes more for the train
as you walk to your hotel you can look around at the shops in chinatown places you might want to come back to eat to shop
uh affordable but you want to bring your girlfriend there right
uh affordable but you want to bring your girlfriend there right
do you mind chinese food
this is a very special chinese food
uh it's right in the heart of chinatown and the restaurant is called lee kui uh (ah hoi)
uh it's right in the heart of chinatown and the restaurant is called lee kui uh (ah hoi)
uh it's in a street called mosque street

uh it-
i- uh it's a special dialect kind of food
the cold crab is tasty

people are used to chili crab
but if you don't like chili this is a little bit uh closer to not hurting your taste buds
but if you don't like chili this is a little bit uh closer to not hurting your taste buds
uh it has got gravy to go with it as well
uh except that the cold crab is in fact raw

uh the pork you know when you cook you get these gravies that form a jelly
and it's very tasty
so it's almost like you're eating a dessert that is savoury in taste
three people um maybe seventy dollars i would think
it depends on how big is your appetite how much you order
and uh yam paste
and uh yam paste
uh yam paste is quite a sweet dessert
the yam is cooked uh that would be the ending of your meal

so if you have eaten too much you can skip the dessert
yes that-
yah
that would be quite nice
i think it's a little bit like a filipino type of dessert
it's uh sweet and it's sticky you know

all over
when you walk out of your hotel and you walk down the main road you will find that there are lots of little streets leading off the main road that is called north bridge road
when you walk out of your hotel and you walk down the main road you will find that there are lots of little streets leading off the main road that is called north bridge road
and they have stalls set up along the road so you can check out the stalls
ha~ uh t-shirts are just a few dollars
uh they are not the high end sort
and you can also buy souvenirs like ten dollars for three souvenirs
and they would be all different kinds different colours
let me get you the mrt map again
well- all along the same street there are other restaurants
so you can just you know walk through and have a look
and quite often in chinatown they display their menu outside so you can gauge what the actual prices of the food you are going to eat will cost
what i'm giving you is just an estimate
what i'm giving you is just an estimate
uh let me show you
uh are you hearing me
okay
let me show you first from your hotel in chinatown to go to the place i recommended for you to do your proposal if you don't want to do it at the rooftop of your hotel okay uh-
so you take the um line- the blue line right down to harbourfront
and here is the start of the north east line
so you switch you go to the circle line which is the yellow line
and you move along to just one stop in fact
and you move along to just one stop in fact
uh one or two stops it doesn't make a difference
uh one or two stops it doesn't make a difference
either telok blangah or labrador you get off uh the bus- uh get off the train and you get on to a bus
either telok blangah or labrador you get off uh the bus- uh get off the train and you get on to a bus
uh when you reached the bus stop at the back there will be signs to tell you the buses that stops there and the route it's going
uh when you reached the bus stop at the back there will be signs to tell you the buses that stops there and the route it's going
so you have to look for one that says "alexandra road" and "hortpark"
so you have to look for one that says "alexandra road" and "hortpark"
yes and hortpark
which is just one street down
so the bus will make a turn and it will drop you almost in front- in fact it is in front of this garden that i'm telling you about
yah
yes
very good
uh that will be a very nice romantic setting
uh that will be a very nice romantic setting
and it shouldn't be too crowded
uh it will give you a little bit of privacy
uh it will give you a little bit of privacy
you just need to bring maybe if you want to bring snacks or something uh you can have a little picnic
if you walk into the garden there are sheltered areas there
and bring your camera you can take lots of photos
you just need to bring a plastic bag to make sure you collect all your leftover uh crackers or cups and then you dispose them in the proper bins
okay
you see the same blue line from chinatown
so this time you take it to harbourfront but you walk to the bus terminals uh which is uh just nearby
and you will also pass a food centre so you might want to check out some of the local foods there
we have a lot of uh muslim food and we also have my favourite fish soup stall there in the middle of the food centre
we have a lot of uh muslim food and we also have my favourite fish soup stall there in the middle of the food centre
but if you're in a hurry then you just go just behind the food centre a few steps away to the bus bay right at the corner next to the mrt station and you board a shuttle bus that goes into sentosa directly
uh you can also cross the road and take the light rail but i think this way it's much easier
uh sentosa itself is only two dollars to enter
and one dollar for your bus ride
and when you come out- uh you are not given tickets when you come out it's free of charge to take the buses out
now i'm showing you universal studios now
yes
there is an entrance fee
uh you can buy a package
uh you can buy a package
sometimes they have- uh during certain promotions they give you special prices
but yah um you are not coming on a public holiday right
it's not the easter weekend
it is the easter weekend
it is
um can you see the prices there
i suggest you budget at these prices first
uh at the highest so that you you know it will cost you seventy four dollars uh each for you and your girlfriend and- oh actually for all three of you
uh at the highest so that you you know it will cost you seventy four dollars uh each for you and your girlfriend and- oh actually for all three of you
so it's-
two hundred
it's two hundred and twenty two
yes
and if you want to eat in chinatown at the food centre's uh street side it's very cheap
uh noodles would be about four dollars rice for five dollars the most
you can- you will take lots of pictures in this area
it's very pretty
uh do you notice they have a two-day package and a three-day package
so if you were to visit all the attractions one day is not enough
so if you were to visit all the attractions one day is not enough
that's right i-
that's right i-
although for you as a tourist to enter it is free of charge to enter to gamble
you could enter just to have a look and then come out again
you might want to propose to your girlfriend first because a visit to sentosa uh may tire her for the next day
so uh propose to her and then the second day you can bring her to universal studios
so uh propose to her and then the second day you can bring her to universal studios
yah
that's right
what else do you think uh you would like to do in singapore
okay
the merlion statue- uh let me get on to the mrt map for you
okay
so say you're at your hotel here in chinatown
and you get off there
that's a very interesting historic area
uh before you go to the merlion you will be passing by our supreme court and city hall
both of them would be combined
um you can walk from there towards the seaward side and uh you would be able to see the merlion
um you can walk from there towards the seaward side and uh you would be able to see the merlion
you walk across a big field across from where they are renovating these two buildings
very scenic
say again please
are you thinking of ethnic areas uh also
are you thinking of ethnic areas uh also
okay
besides chinatown- well for history first by the river that's very historic place because uh where the merlion is uh nearby is the start of the mouth of the singapore river
and that's where sir stamford raffles landed which he's a british who came here to look for a trading port
so and the whole riverside the buildings have been conserved
so it's an interesting walk huh
so it's an interesting walk huh
uh you could walk in fact along the river or you could from your hotel in chinatown take the line to little india and soak in some indian culture in that area
i-
to little india uh usually two stops about 5 minutes
but on this line
but on this line
so maybe seven or eight minutes but uh you have to factor in walking down to the station in getting out so maybe twenty minutes
yes that's right
you can take photos of the flower garland makers the uh vegetable sellers and visit the hindu temples before twelve o'clock
because they- yah they close around twelve to about four o'clock and then they reopen
and it is open till nine o'clock
and it is open till nine o'clock
and you can eat there also since you say you like chili
you can both be very happy
e~ there is also dessert stall in chinatown uh that specialises in uh pureed sesame paste and pureed peanut paste
uh just about one street away from where you are
uh just about one street away from where you are
uh just about one street away from where you are
the area where the merlion is is actually where we have the seafront
uh but the seafront that you see is now a reservoir to collect rainwater that falls in the city area and also to prevent flooding
uh if you want to walk i think on men~ sentosa uh after you visit universal studios take a walk along the beach that would be better
historical places
if you want- uh what sort of history do you want
war history or do you want to see a museum about uh local lifestyle
okay
okay that is very um convenient because right in chinatown we have the chinatown heritage uh centre which shows you life in a building like yours but in its original form
so it's called the chinatown heritage centre and it's right where you are you just walk two streets down
so it's called the chinatown heritage centre and it's right where you are you just walk two streets down
it's called the changi prison museum or changi museum
you can actually go by bus all the way number two bus
and you can have sight see along the way
but uh if you prefer to go there faster you take a train uh to tanah merah
yah tanah merah
and then you switch to number two bus
and then you switch to number two bus
and you are right outside the museum
yes
yes
that's what you're buying it for for the trains and buses and the buses
uh huh
so you don't worry about uh carrying loose change on knowing how much you know
so fix your problem
uh to stroll around and take pictures would be the areas i have recommended
if you want uh garden do you like gardens uh besides hortpark
we have another garden that is very famous and older one
we have another garden that is very famous and older one
and from harbourfront you take the yellow line all the way to botanic gardens
that's also quite romantic for proposal but it would be busier
it's- also more of uh open space whereas if you reached hortpark and it's raining they have a big covered area near the entrance where you can wait out the rain and you can walk to this place where i said you can propose to your girlfriend
you-
i- another part of history that you might like to visit it is uh a museum that is near to the city hall stop
and it's also near the merlion and it's called the asian civilisation's museum
uh not inside the museum because you know when you have your camera flash on it's uh it fades the photograph- uh the exhibits
and i- maybe for security also they usually do not allow photography inside
yes
uh inside if you want to see the history of singapore only uh there is a foyer on the upstairs level you can take the lift or walk up the stairs
and that's free of charge
you are most welcome
you are most welcome
uh do you need anything else
uh maybe you want to go to a church or anything else
okay
because in that area we also have an anglican church catholic churches
uh i'm not so familiar with uh-
wha~ yes evangelist
we have new creation church and new life church
but i'm not so good with uh-
yah
uh i am not sure about the protestant churches but uh in the catholic churches they allow you
and the catholic and anglican churches have lots of statues inside you know of their saints
uh let me show you a picture of one of them
yes saint andrews
this is a church of england anglican church
it's a- yah
it's a national monument
and we also have a bit of war history on the walls
uh because uh during the war the british were here and some died and so people put up plaques in church to remember them
uh because uh during the war the british were here and some died and so people put up plaques in church to remember them
yes
and it's a very active church they- in fact they have a little sunken area nearby
because they cannot expand the church because it's a protected building
because they cannot expand the church because it's a protected building
so there is a sunken area on the other side of the building where they have uh- they use for other purposes when they have not enough space within the church
so there is a sunken area on the other side of the building where they have uh- they use for other purposes when they have not enough space within the church
uh the catholic churches are just within walking distance across the road from there
uh the catholic churches are just within walking distance across the road from there
and they were all built in the eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds
and they were all built in the eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds
so they are a bit like this
in fact more on it because you know catholics have lots of statues of saints
and the way of the cross along the walls so it's great for photography

okay the price that you pay for admission to the universal studio includes uh almost all the rides in universal studio
so yes that is already included
yes
yes
seventy four dollars for weekends and holidays
child will be fifty dollars uh and fifty four for uh public holidays and sundays- uh weekends
child will be fifty dollars uh and fifty four for uh public holidays and sundays- uh weekends
okay closest hotel of course would be on sentosa island
we have a few uh resort that is located on the island
for example uh we have um- okay i'm going to show you the hotels okay
crockford hotel uh hotel michael hardrock hotel festive hotel equarius and beach villas
these are located just in the whole of resort world
okay so if you're talking about very close these are the hotels
do you want me to provide you the price range
and above for one room
yes
because these are resort hotels
alright there is a very uh a hotel small hotel that is quite near to uh- on the mainland that is quite near to the uh harbourfront where you will take the sentosa express to get on to the universal studio
and the name of this hotel is harbourville
okay
okay this one is in the region of uh approximately uh about a hundred and fifteen dollars
yes per night
okay this is the hotel
it's just a small hotel uh no uh restaurant facilities
yes it's about a hundred and twenty five dollars
okay now if you wanna a lit~ something a little bit better uh i would say this hotel uh just about uh one stop away uh from the harbourfront
okay there is this hotel called m hotel
okay it's located in the financial district area
okay
so this would be uh a nicer hotel alright
it is still convenient to get there
but otherwise uh most of the hotels are even in orchard road is not that difficult to get to the harbourfront
but otherwise uh most of the hotels are even in orchard road is not that difficult to get to the harbourfront
uh this would be in the region of two hundred over uh dollars
two hundred plus
yes
yes correct
per night means you check-in at three o'clock two o'clock three o'clock and you will have to leave the hotel by twelve the next day
okay uh eighty dollars
do you mind staying in a backpackers' hotel
okay we do have uh backpackers' hotel in singapore
okay there are quite a lot of uh backpackers' hotel in singapore
now uh again depending on the uh location that is-
yes that you want to stay
okay i'm giving you some list here of the hotels for backpackers'
they are all below a hundred dollars
yah
as close as possible
okay then i would say that uh there is a hotel called the inns over in chinatown
i think that would be very close already uh to the uh harbourfront
yes
yes that's right
okay i'm showing you now this uh that inn over at temple street
uh it will be for uh one person
the rates
yes you are right in the heart of chinatown
okay because this hote~ uh this uh hotel is located in chinatown so there are lots of dining options
there are um uh restaurants quite a lot of chinese restaurants including dimsum just next street and all the lanes around the chinatown area
and over there um they serve uh local food and one meal let's say if you are just having the uh rice with three dishes that will cost you approximately about five singapore dollars
so with a drink it's less than seven dollars you could have a full meal
so with a drink it's less than seven dollars you could have a full meal
tem~ okay uh this is very conveniently located
the other ho~ uh mrt would be tanjong pagar
now tanjong pagar is actually the east-west line that you will take to go to the um harbourfront alright
uh but if you are sorry
uh no you take the chinatown uh station and go to the harbourfront
um but let say you are going to take uh to the singapore flyer then you will have to take from tanjong pagar and alight at the city hall and you take a walk about fifteen min~ seventeen minutes' walk to the singapore flyer
uh on sentosa island we don't have subway
uh we have what we call the sentosa buses that you can board
uh it's all included in your ticket
a visa coming in to singapore or a visa to sentosa
a visa coming in to singapore or a visa to sentosa
uh which uh visa are you talking about
okay you won't require a visa to come to singapore
so it's part of singapore
so there's no visa requirement
uh the flight tickets
okay again i think it depends on which airline that you are taking
okay again i think it depends on which airline that you are taking
uh ya really very much depending of the airlines that you are taking
or would you be able to-
more affordable airlines coming to singapore
uh i would think uh do you have budget airlines coming in
okay
uh you have the cebupacific airlines coming into singapore
yes i think that would be a cheaper ticket coming in from um singapore
coming in to singapore
uh we have the same kind of temperature throughout the whole year
uh so there's no uh really specific time
okay maybe i'll just give you a run down um i would say that it will be good to time your holidays uh together with our major festivals here like february or january period will be chinese new year
uh it gives you that festive mood
and uh the hari raya sometime in uh august alright
and uh the hari raya sometime in uh august alright
deepavali-
yes sometime in november
yes sometime in november
and christmas time is also a very festive because uh we light up the whole street of orchard road
so it gives you that very festive mood
um the rest of the hari raya deepavali we light up other streets in singapore
so that gives you a very good a photography area for you to bring home uh some memories of singapore
yah
yah
yah we don't have major festival in the month of april
yes
okay you will have to uh- the mrt ride will take you approximately about forty five minutes to get to the northern part of singapore
okay you will have to uh- the mrt ride will take you approximately about forty five minutes to get to the northern part of singapore
and you will alight at the mrt train station called the ang mo kio station
and from there you change a bus number one three eight to get to the night safari
so it will be better for you to allocate at least about one and a half hours from the hotel to the night safari park
yes
the entrance fee will be thirty two dollars for an adult and a child will be twenty one dollars
yes the tram ride is included uh for the uh price that i have quoted you
yes the tram ride is included uh for the uh price that i have quoted you
okay this is a wild park
that means the animals are not tame so uh yes we do not uh encourage anyone to feed the animals
they are well-taken care of uh by the zoo keepers
uh and they have uh regular feeding time
so we don't want the animals to put on too much weight
and they will be eating the wrong kind food if we give them the human food
so they have special uh food that the zoo keepers will feed them
so strictly no feeding
so strictly no feeding
um and also uh we- for the night safari because these animals most of the animals are nocturnal creatures
uh we do not uh want to damage the eyes of these uh nocturnal creatures because being nocturnal creatures they have very sharp uh eyesight
uh we do not uh want to damage the eyes of these uh nocturnal creatures because being nocturnal creatures they have very sharp uh eyesight
so we don't want to damage uh their eyes
and that's why we don't want any flash photographies on the animals
but if you want to take pictures of your friends or uh just the backdrop uh without the animals yes then you can take uh pictures with the flash
hm yes the highlight of course eh some of the rarer animals that we don't get to see so close uh to us
i would be- you see this tram ride
do not stretch them out
do not touch the animals because they are wild animals
so this is something interesting as well as and of course on the tram ride the deers will also come very close to the tram alright
so these are i would say interesting and highlight
yah uh so you are actually just separated by the um leopards
they're so-close to the leopards and i think uh it's going to be a real highlight
yah
so you can see uh the spots alright
every spot of the leopard
yah
but uh in order to see this leopard you will have to walk uh remember just now the tram ride
okay now when you are in the night safari you get on the tram ride
now in the middle of the tram ride there is a stop so you can get off and do a short walk for about thirty minutes and you get to see the leopard up close and personal
now when you finish this walk just come back to the main entrance and board another tram and that would bring you back to the main entrance
now again on the screen you can see there is fishing cat trail
if you're not too tired you can do this trail and the trail would take you about twenty minutes
and again the last trail it will be the forest giant trail right
so these are the three uh trails uh that you can do um for the uh tour over in the night safari
okay so it's up to you whether you are too tired you don't feel like walking on the tram ride you see seventy per cent of the animals
we have a night shows at the um uh night safari park
we call it the creatures of the night show
and um it's a different uh from a circus show
we'll just show you some of the animals that will be coming up
alright
yes there you see the zoo keeper
alright bringing up not the uh lions
um so they will be just doing um what they normally do like feeding you know how do they uh take their food
um yah
so these are just things that they do
otherwise this is the fire show
uh it is comes on every night um and they will be performing at the front- at the entrance of the night safari park
now to see the creatures of the night show normally it's a long queue uh so you have to queue there uh you have to be uh um at the queuing up for this show a little bit early
usually uh more than half an hours in advance
yes
okay their show is included
so uh if you want to see this show is they are all included in their admission ticket
uh no uh like i sa~ mention all the animals in the night safari park are wild animals
so only the zoo keepers allowed to touch them
yes because they are still wild animals
the night safari starts at seven thirty a~
twelve midnight yes
yes you uh- from seven thirty to twelve midnight you definitely have a lot of time uh to see everything in the night safari park
uh not necessary about three hours is already good enough

yes you can leave at about ten thirty
yes you can leave at about ten thirty
that is sufficient
yes
uh ten thirty you can still take the public bus
uh one three eight back to the ang mo kio mrt train station and from there take uh um a train back to your hotel
now in singapore it's pretty safe to travel around in the night
yah
the giraffe is just a few months old
yah
uh no like i mention all our animals are wild animals
so uh it's not- they are not tame at all
alright
uh sorry what do you say
uh sorry what do you say
like for example rock climbing
okay we have uh this rock climbing right in the heart of orchard road
but it's on a wall actually
and you will be in a building
borderx alright
and it's right in the heart of the shopping belt
yes of course
you need safety gear to climb up this wall
okay this is borderx
the mrt train station will be somerset station
okay now let me just try and show you the photograph of this borderx
yes uh a wall i would say
uh it's about three-story tall
again it depends on uh how is your fitness level
okay
uh it should be in the region of thirty four uh dollars
yes
okay
okay yes
okay it's thirty three dollars for the uh- okay they just want to experience the climbing is twenty three for weekday and twenty eight uh for weekend
uh yes and all the climbing gear the safety gear will all be provided
yah
so it's open from monday to friday uh one to ten pm
saturday sunday would be from eleven to ten pm
yah it's a thirty-metre vertical wall
okay i think you have to be a little bit fit for this
okay
so this is uh something that's exciting out here
okay
uh well if you like food because a lot of the local people like to eat out here
it's a kind of cookie and inside you have this um pineapple um paste in there so it's called pineapple tarts
now all the other races the major races we cook this or we bake this pineapple tart
so you'll be able to pick up this uh from the bakery shop they would have uh the pineapple tarts
some of them are vacuum packed as well so it's very easy for you to bring home uh to your country
uh exotic like how exotic
crocodile meat
turtle meat
yes we do have them here
but of course you have to look specially for the restaurants
uh for turtle soup you will have to go to some of this uh non-air-conditioned coffee shops
uh where they serve this uh herbal turtle soup
well they have so many interesting food out here
so it's really difficult to talk about the best uh food
um so maybe can we be a little bit more specific
more unique to singapore
sorry what did you like to have
heavy meal
heavy meal
okay so you are a foodie uh
okay maybe i will say uh things food that we have here in singapore that you don't readily get them in uh philippines right
maybe uh fried hokkien noodles
you can get them in our food centre whether air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned
so something that is easily available and i would say our majority of the local uh favourite food
fried hokkien noodle okay
so i'm going to give you this alright
so uh this is the- let me just show you
yah it's actually with a bit of seafood like uh kara mani um okay
okay i'm gonna show you some of the food now
i think it's a little bit small here
so some-
this is fried hokkien noodles fried with prawn kara mani and it's yellow noodle and white noodle
another yes you can see right
yah
and another dish that i would like to recommend you will be fried carrot cake
and another dish that i would like to recommend you will be fried carrot cake
this is a savoury food
this is a savoury food
okay it's savoury
okay it's savoury
it's actually white radish
you can see it's actually white radish um cooked with rice flour and that is the black version
you can see it's actually white radish um cooked with rice flour and that is the black version
it's has been cooked with black soya sauce black sauce
it's has been cooked with black soya sauce black sauce
yah so it has a tinge of sweetness in there
the white colour will be savoury
so i don't think you get this food back home
so i like to just recommend you this two food and of course a lot more um uh food that we have
yah so- yah so it's not the normal uh orange carrot uh
it's actually white radish but we can call it the fried carrot cake
so a lot more uh um food that i recommend but like i said i think these are two just two recipes that you may not get them at home
yes
uh if you get from the uh non-air-conditioned food centre we call it hawker centre
one plate of this would cost you only three dollars
yah
yes
yah you can have it for either breakfast lunch or dinner
okay now singapore is not that big
okay now singapore is not that big
okay there are so many clubs uh that are very good
uh again it depends on price range
so i will give you uh some of the clubs uh that you can do in singapore
okay
but most important uh they are very good clubs right
okay this is a zouk alright it's a very famous in singapore
um it's just about half an hour uh distance- uh travelling time for you
okay and uh the budget there it's- well can range from forty to hundred dollars
it's a very good dance club
um next door there is uh the younger uh i would say the younger brother uh of zouk okay
so there are two clubs there that you can do
otherwise you can go to saint james powerstation
okay there are three clubs here; zouk phuture and devil underground
uh you can also go to saint james powerstation
so you want something more affordable right
okay this is an entertainment complex
okay this is an entertainment complex
um so there are quite a few clubs there uh that you can uh do
yes they do have
so generally out there okay it's a bit noisy- now i'm going to turn off this
over at saint james it range from about forty dollars up to a hundred
you're familiar with this club
okay
so maybe is something a little bit more affordable would be this club
okay let me give you this
uh are you talking about alcoholic or non-alcohol
for alcohol uh we have a very good selection of wines uh from all over the world
um from shiraz pinot noir
okay so really hard to pinpoint
so we have so many uh variety uh of uh wine here in singapore
okay cocktail-wise again a very good selection and in fact some of the clubs that you're gonna visit they would have their own concoction
so really difficult
but one of our local uh cocktail yes
uh that would be the singapore sling
um so it's a little mild kind of a cocktail drink pink in colour
yah so that is something uh that is local um otherwise a very good selection of wine and like i said cocktail
yah
yes it's a gin sling uh that would be something that is locally concocted
uh yah
so the other club that i recommend you which is a little bit cheaper would be double o okay that is at queen street
yah
that will be a little bit uh cheaper
okay unfortunately i don't think the website is on
okay let see whether this- okay yup this is double o
yah so it will be a bit cheaper compared to zouk
okay
alright
yes it's a well-known club

uh no we don't have that kind of sand out on the mainland
uh it's just a place where the local people chill out over the weekend

okay
yes we- yes
eastern part we have the east coast and changi beach

so let say if you are doing the ifly the um universal studio on sentosa island then you could do this museum because they are in the uh southern part of singapore
uh you know because you also mention that you don't want to spend too much time travelling
so they are in like basically the same location so you could this museum
it's a good museum and there is a show inside the museum
uh but basically this museum uh shows you uh the last battle of singapore at the southern part of singapore
and uh last uh- that area is the defended by the uh malay regiment of singapore
so that was a very fierce battle that was fought in the southern part of singapore
alright
so yes
again if you are going to sentosa we have another museum there
uh it's called fort siloso
yes it's on sentosa
so again you know you easily can spend a number of days just on sentosa
so i'm going to show you some images of fort siloso
and this one here will be the surrender of the british to the japanese in nineteen forty three alright
so it shows you the war um that happened uh on in sentosa alright
okay uh- okay this one the entrance is ten dollar
uh that is also ten dollars
uh that is also ten dollars
yes
okay but again it depends on what you want to see
okay but again it depends on what you want to see
this is on uh fort siloso
okay
yes so i'm just showing you images of the fort siloso
this museum it's uh some parts of it are open air
uh whereas the other one would be a indoor kind of a museum
so we are talking about different uh focus of war uh for this uh two museum
and of course there are lot more other museums
so i just uh recommend you this two uh for the time being
so you have been doing a lot of uh- well i have recommended you a lot of exciting things to do
do you want to tone down things a little bit
ifly
uh yes you could do all these yes in two to three days
uh yes you could do all these yes in two to three days
um because besides the attraction that we talk about there are other attractions like the other parks uh images uh there's a museum also another museum showcasing the history of singapore
uh so again yes easily two to three days
and what are the things that you want to do
and what are the things that you want to do
the- the what-
the hotel okay
so we were talking that you don't mind uh backpackers' hotel right

okay yes
i'm listing for you quite a lot of the backpacker hotel
uh okay all these are all in the range of twenty over dollars to fifty dollars uh per night
okay all these hotels that you are seeing now on the screen
um and quite a lot of them are in pretty good location
near the beach backpackers' hotel
not that near the beach alright
walk to the beach
no i mean but eastern part of singapore
so we don't-
you still can't walk to the beach uh even though we have some backpackers' hotel in the east
you still can't walk to the beach uh even though we have some backpackers' hotel in the east
uh would i be able to recommend you this hotel call sleepy sam

ten minutes' walk to the mrt train station
okay
so this is uh one of the backpackers' hotel and just like i said it's a good review out here

but this is a youth hotel
it's call the betel uh box uh hostel

uh night club uh of course uh very famous club we have it's zouk z o u k
uh it's near the- just about ten minutes from the financial district area
uh it's near the- just about ten minutes from the financial district area
we have uh world famous ku dÉ ta that's at the uh marina bay sands resort
something a little bit cheaper would be double o okay that's at the queen street area
uh if you like local bands we have uh a club call home
yah
uh no uh the club on sentosa uh no really like uh dance club on sentosa
we have just drinking places
yah so there are drinking places by the beach uh that serve wine cocktail soft drinks
yah so there are drinking places by the beach uh that serve wine cocktail soft drinks
so what kind of music do you like
um hip-hop local bands
hip-hop
just acoustic
home-grown
it's called home
no it's not so expensive
no it's not so expensive
okay
well the location- i don't think i have the pictures for you to see
uh but this is uh located um just at uh boat quay area
the southern part of singapore
so there are quite a few uh bars and clubs uh located uh around the clarke quay area
okay so if you are talking about hip-hop then it will be butter factory
okay this is uh hip-hop sorry
oh no you don't need the tour guide for your uh clubbing right
oh no you don't need the tour guide for your uh clubbing right
or well there are always uh like-minded people over in all these clubs
so this is uh hip-hop and r and b
yah
so again they are all located in very centralised uh area uh in singapore
so again they are all located in very centralised uh area uh in singapore
okay dress code uh just club fashion
clubbing there
okay just to tone down things a little bit
uh you can do this uh very uh relaxing cruise on the singapore river
uh just an half an hour ride
uh just an half an hour ride
uh that would be fifteen dollars
uh that would be fifteen dollars
uh no no i think your most expensive cost that you'll be spending here will probably be your clubbing i think right
oh dear
okay so this is the- just to tone down things a little bit
okay so this is the- just to tone down things a little bit
uh you can just take a river cruise
uh you can just take a river cruise
okay
uh yes you can take anytime of the day we have this cruise
uh yes you can take anytime of the day we have this cruise
just about half an hour ride on the uh singapore river
uh yes the price is the same but of course we are looking at uh different scenery
okay you are just looking at different scenery
uh like i said you know since you are going to do so much exciting things in singapore so we just tone down things a little bit
okay yes
okay you'll be seeing this uh and this is the boat
okay you'll be seeing this uh and this is the boat
let me show you the boat
i don't know whether you see this boat out there
and the buildings behind is actually is boat quay
so if you are taking in the daytime this cruise then of course it's a totally different kind of scenery
the night cruise when all the lights comes on and again a different view of uh singapore on the river itself
okay
yah so you have to come back a few times huh not just one okay
yah
otherwise you can't finish everything that you want to do here
welcome
welcome
alright so we hope to see you in singapore soon
alright so we hope to see you in singapore soon
alright
welco~ okay same to you
bye
could you spell your name again please
oh arlyn i see
i am tour guide number two and my name is jeanne
i am tour guide number two and my name is jeanne
good morning arlyn
hi arlyn
how can i help you
okay in may
and- so the dates are flexible you are not uh- you haven't book anything yet
what are your interests
but what particularly are- is your husband and you- uh what do you normally do when you're relaxing
a theme park okay
how old is your daughter
oh she's only four years old okay
uh but at four years old uh- some of the rides she may not be able to take
you can visit the theme parks but uh like the roller coaster rides and all that they may have restrictions on uh on the height or the age of children for some of the rides because of her size
you can bring her to the gardens uh you can bring her to the zoo and also the bird park and the night safari
uh night safari
can i uh show you about the uh singapore wildlife reserves that runs all three parks
just give me a moment
so what you're seeing is an aviary where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park
so what you're seeing is an aviary where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park
and this the night safari tram ride which you can take uh if you are too tired to walk or you can walk as well as you know take the ride
if- uh you can go in a little bit earlier but they won't let you ride inside to take the tram ride until after the sun goes down which is seven o'clock
uh those are tapirs that you see along the ride
now this is the day zoo can you see elephants of asia
so this is one of the shows that you see at the zoo which is next to the night safari
so you should visit
uh if she likes the zoo very much because they have a children's uh playground area in there and she can take a little uh like a train around the zoo uh in the children's playground
uh if she likes the zoo very much because they have a children's uh playground area in there and she can take a little uh like a train around the zoo uh in the children's playground
she can also uh see- you know pet the little animals the small ones that are like rabbits and uh pygmy horses you know
the very small and tame animals she can uh do rides and she can handle them and the shows are directed at children
the very small and tame animals she can uh do rides and she can handle them and the shows are directed at children
yes there are uh times where you can ride the elephants or the horses in the zoo
yes there are uh times where you can ride the elephants or the horses in the zoo
yes that's right they- because they are run under one organisation known as wildlife reserves
and-
yes for all of them
normally you have a month to use up the ticket but- so if you're staying just two or three days you would definitely use it up
okay river safari is new
and it takes you from one part of the zoo to another part and you're lucky because it has just opened
so of course you're not going to go to all those rivers that was shown just now but it's a simulation
so here you go you can see uh crocodiles- baby crocodile here
yes you take the boat and you can see the exhibits and on the boat ride the guide will show you um you know the skin the moult of the uh snakes
yes you take the boat and you can see the exhibits and on the boat ride the guide will show you um you know the skin the moult of the uh snakes
things that you don't normally see when you uh just visit a zoo but when you take the ride you can see exhibits that they have collected
you know when the animals die they have these specimens
now the panda that you just saw they have not yet come
but they are coming okay so we are just uh waiting for them arrive
yes this uh night- uh the river safari is uh a new trail
they had a river ride all along but now they have enhanced it
so you see at the bottom there the different zones
uh yes it is
uh it's uh forty hectares if i remember correctly the riv~ the whole zoo
yah
uh they actually have ninety hectares in total but they haven't develop the whole area
so uh the night safari uh- shall i show you pictures of that
night safari gives you uh very magical feel because here we have nocturnal animals and also some animals that are both nocturnal and diurnal
so we have settle lighting uh at where they feed and then they will put food at these places
so sometimes they stop and uh uh let- they have to stop to let the tapirs have right of way
you can take photos in the zoo and the bird park but not at the night safari uh at the animals
you can take when they are doing the show you can take cozying in the open areas but not at the animals because we won't- don't want to spook them
that's the only thing
okay
uh do you want to see the zoo
did i show you the zoo
that's the naked mole rat that's why they called it the nudist colony
you won't see naked people there don't worry
okay
and here you see
are you getting it on your screen
the three animals at the back that look like hairy monkeys they are orang-utans
that you normally have to go into the forest to see uh but here some of them are actually bred in our zoo and they are trained so they come out and you can take a photograph with them even your daughter
that would make a good souvenir photograph yah
uh no because uh where you're eating is separate from where they are and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating
so they don't come and help themselves to your food
you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area and you're looking at i think some lemurs at the back there will be butterflies fluttering birds flying around it's an open area to show you the ecosystem in a forest
uh so the specimens inside or rather the exhibits inside there are all tamed and quite friendly
including the two-toed sloth
you know the very slow moving sloth that uh it's up the tree
it's very hard to see in the jungle you can see it here
are you there
yah
you can volunteer uh your daughter when they asked for volunteers at the bird park show and also at the uh day zoo tour and if they selected then she'll be the star of the show
especially yes having your wedding anniversary
so shall i show you- you were asking about ticketing right
uh oh just hold on a minute
oh i think it's- wait
okay
can you see the park hoppers' specials
so three in one because if you go to all three parks you are paying only fifty eight dollars
and if you visit just the night safari and zoo it's forty eight
there is a saving because the individual tickets are costed at a higher price
s~ the only thing is it doesn't- uh oh it includes the night safari tram ride but uh not the tram ride within the day zoo
so if you want to take a tram within the singapore zoo in the day time you have to pay about five dollars or so for the tram ride
you can also walk uh after you do your tram ride if you have time because then you can see uh on the night safari different set of animals and the day zoo she can get closer up to all the animals
yah
yes that's right you see thirty days to use it up
but if you go to the night safari and the zoo uh at the same time because they are next to each other you save on the fare and the time you save time travelling
you can visit the zoo starting from morning 'till evening or you can visit it in the afternoon 'till about six o'clock and then just walk across to the night safari
okay
uh do you want to see pictures of the tram ride
you're okay huh
alright
cultural shows uh- we have activities- if you're thinking of your daughter we have activities within our museums targeted at children
uh but uh culturals shows no we have more the adult theme shows
okay
but if you are talking about chinese malay indian dance we used to include it on a city tour but uh it's not really uh a show that you just go on and see you know um like in many other places
just give me a minute to get you the resort the sentosa resort
uh the mar~ we have a re~ big resort on sentosa island
okay
what you can see- i don't call it cultural actually it's uh got uh pyrotechnics
so if you like the beach and you go to sentosa you can see this show
so it's not the traditional cultural show you know what i mean
but your daughter might enjoy this it's uh full of colour you can see there
yes music
uh before that uh the people will be encouraging you to sing along with them
so this is more high-tech it's what i think people like today
so you go there in the evening can you see the times here at seven-
and eight forty
and because it's popular they have an additional show on saturdays and public holidays usually there's an additional show
yes
uh i think premium seats are more in the centre and let me scroll down i think these are premium seats
perhaps padded there you are
so you pay for the cushioning and you get a very good view
but i think here you'll get a better view
you are right in the centre so that you can see it very well
you are right in the centre so that you can see it very well
yes just a moment
so i know i'm not answering your question directly about cultural shows
these are more fun things that uh singaporeans also go to enjoy
and i have seen this show myself
uh there's a lot of acrobatics uh very spectacular
uh the cast is international
yah
so there you see it's uh our longest running show
oh i can't remember exactly
the story is simple about a young man on a journey but it is more- you see the dancing you see the acrobatics
uh let me see they must have a day off probably
okay
they are taking from wednesday to friday from october the first yes
so that means i think monday and tuesday is their day off
i- for sure the acrobats they need a break so wednesday and friday at eight thirty but saturday and sunday they have a matinee show
and i think-
i think it's their annually from twelve to twenty third of september
yah
frankly you don't need to have the hundred and eighty eight dollar tickets
they- yes i think they do let me see
they don't have child rates though
so kids have to pay the same rate as adults
the theatre isn't very large i don't know the actual capacity but i was inside and i think it's not like so huge that if you pay hundred and eight dollars you can't see very well
some people don't have the performers right you know too near them it could be scary
so uh hundred and eight dollars would be fine
yes
uh high-end shops we have down at orchard road which is the main tourist belt with the more expensive hotels or the better class hotels
uh high-end shops we have down at orchard road which is the main tourist belt with the more expensive hotels or the better class hotels
uh then we have also shopping malls uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront
vivocity is newer and it has got uh a very huge singaporean following on uh weekends
i'm showing you orchard road on the screen first
so you can see we've got gucci there
it's- you can get all the good brands there but there are also shops that sell things like g two thousand do you know it
a mid-price range
but the concentration of branded shops would be at orchard road and also at marina bay sands where that we have a casino
okay if- since you're celebrating your wedding anniversary your husband might want to buy you you know something very grand
do you see this picture here
can you see the building
so right on top is the swimming pool but uh-
yes
yes
uh actually infinity pools scare me a little bit i think i'm going to swim right out to see
we have a list of shops here
um i'd like to go to an old store that has kept up with the times and modernised and it's called c k tang
uh here you see- this is a list of the shops you get at marina bay sands uh or rather it's categorised by what you want
so what is your preference i can select for you
jewellery
okay these are the stores we have bulgari uh cartier all the branded uh-
uh from the store window
citigems is- i think it's local tio tianpo also
so can you see citigems on your screen
so this is a huge shopping area called the shoppes at marina bay sands can you see on the right hand side of your screen
so this if you want to spare your husband you go to citigems
yes
okay
you haven't selected your hotel huh have you
okay but uh-
we have got marina bay sands still on the screen so we'll have to wait for it first and then we search for your hotel
okay
i want to suggest to you this hotel in chinatown
it is quite romantic
it is a boutique hotel- oops
you see the building was built in nineteen twenty nine hence the name of the hotel but it was bought over by a young man who likes to uh restore old buildings
and here you see the facade of the hotel
it's got bay windows
so you don't have dates you're just talking about may is it
okay
may
what day in may are you thinking of
wednesday the ninth
because may day would be on the first
uh if they have higher rates on that ti~ at that time they might be charging a bit more
yah
room so are you taking one room or two rooms
one room is enough huh
uh one room
because your daughter is only four or we can put it as two guests but you can ask for an extra bed when you are there
and i have in fact visited it when uh it was uh completed and they have uh even a room where you can have uh a bath looking out into the sky
uh i did- we did step into the bathroom and check out because you know around there are skyscrapers all the hotel uh buildings and uh office buildings but they have a lot of greenery around and so that it shades off- it shades you off from the view of anybody nearby
superior room is called the terrace suite can you see the price
yes
it's quite fun actually if you are not the shy type
you are
it is uh quite okay you should actually check it out and have a look
it's just that you know uh this is quite nice because it's right at the top of the hotel the hotel has just about three storeys
okay
here we go
so junior suite that was the next category to the terrace
so can you see everything is new in there
uh you should have enough
uh what was the price of uh your show it's a hundred and eight dollars right
but the- yes uh so in fact you have- we have tickets at forty eight dollars if i remember correctly
uh the junior suite is two hundred plus like two hundred and fourteen dollars
yah
so you stay in two days is that right
seven hundred over dollars yah
you have to go down on your uh expectations for the show
you need to downgrade on your show
okay
this room is a hundred and ninety six dollars deluxe room
yes that would be under two hundred dollars
uh superior double maybe the fittings i'm not sure
you want to see superior double
yes it's the fittings it's a little bit simpler
yes uh very nice very pretty
and you have your own wash basin right next to you
so- maybe you downgrade on your show price tickets
so your rooms uh-
uh somewhere around that just a minute
okay
do you want to see the sup~ you don't want the superior double huh
okay
no s~ okay that's the only picture we have of the room
yah
so we close this
so this is the room you want
yes it's two hundred and fourteen dollars so four hundred and twenty eight dollars
uh do you want to see the show at forty eight dollars or fifty eight dollars
safari price was about sixty- let me see i forget the price
package price for the three in one for the night safari zoo and the bird park right
the wildlife reserves
if you are staying two whole nights one night for the night safari and one night for the show
so let's see the rates
uh the package price is what you want right
okay
so yah it's about sixty dollars
it's fifty eight dollars for the three of you
uh for one of you
so let's take it at sixty so it's about a hundred and eighty dollars for your-
thirty eight dollars so it's only a hundred and sixty dollars
yes uh- but not on a hundred and eight because you want to eat right
you want to unless you have a separate budget for that
uh can you downgrade to the fifty eight dollar ticket for the show
no it's not too far because as i said the hall isn't very big and the performers are right in front of you you know
it is uh- you get a good view
of course there's no child ticket
so you have seven hundred and sixty eight dollars spent more or less now
hm it will not uh break the bank
you use this card to pay for your fare so you don't have to use any money
that's right
and then before you leave any balance value you can get a refund
uh at the airport you pay twelve dollars
here you go can you see
and-
yah
and you would have to top up some money so- or maybe you allow thirty dollars for it just to be safe
so you don't have-
yes
so you don't have to go to a seven eleven store to top up the value if you run out
uh it depends on how far you are going and the places you're going to except for the zoo and uh bird park is the further
it's just a little over two dollars for the both of you
so um-
you need to get three uh- you need to get three uh to to use for your daughter as well and then you get your refund before you leave
so i have provided like ninety dollars for the three of you and you know you have some extra spare
that brings you to- food places
you stay at this hotel in chinatown
go to the maxwell food centre that's the cheapest place for food and the best value because you get authentic chinese food
do you like chinese food
and this place is a very old market that also has been restored
you can see- in other words are you getting chicken or duck or fish
and the people there office workers when you go on a week day uh they will be happy to explain to you what they're eating if you need help
so for your daughter maybe five dollars or even three dollars a plate of something a dollar juice uh if you like
and for your husband and yourself maybe seven or eight dollars each
yes very good uh i eat there quite often
it's you know- uh she serves the best you know
it is- she's very generous with the ingredients chicken and the rice
uh and if you- do you know porridge rice porridge
so don't order like five dollars just order the minimum and you'll get an idea of it
so the taste is also the best and the guidebooks for food have written up about her
uh there is what we called uh teochew porridge
so it is rice porridge and there are sort of variety of dishes like steam fish fried fish uh salted egg vegetables- different vegetables cooked in different ways tofu
so you pick what you want and you eat it
uh so it depends on what you pick fish uh a whole fish of course is more expensive if you are just taking a slice is less and if your taking vegetables usually it's a dollar or seventy cents a little plate
yes very close you can walk there
and you can even eat there every day you will not run out of stalls okay because have so many stalls there uh i think over a hundred
yes
uh there is- there are also indian stalls selling something like uh uh fried pancake
uh that- there probably is but i cannot recall for sure
so it's at the lower end
maybe you pay five dollars for rice and um uh piece of meat a sizeable piece of meat on your rice
and for thai food you will get your usual green mango you know
uh the sour and sweet mango uh and the pad thai you know pad thai
the noodles it's very nice it's a very special thai dish
so if you want to try different cuisines just outside your hotel you can find
we also have a food street there it's called smith street
you can take this down s m i t h street it's the food street of singapore
about more or less the same
yes i go there when i'm in chinatown i will always eat in chinatown
but because my place is quite near to chinatown uh you know i've been- i eat quite often maxwell market especially
so can you see the pictures here
uh okay this one shows the food
okay just wait a while for it to load the picture
you see at night the road is closed off to traffic and the stalls are put out and the stall holders man their cooking just next to the tables
yes but this is for food
and in chinatown the night market is also a day market
so on the next road to this is where they sell things that you can buy like souvenirs
this is smith street where you eat
uh if you walk and you stop and look at shops maybe ten minutes otherwise i- if you walk fast i think five minutes you can get there
so you can get your souvenirs cheap souvenirs uh if you need to buy like for twenty people or thirty people you don't want to spend a fortune
yes but uh there would be things like you know chopsticks with uh-
yes but uh there would be things like you know chopsticks with uh-
uh it's actually along the street side
i don't think they have a website
it is uh a little stalls where they sell uh souvenirs like during the new year they sell we~ decorations for chinese new year
it is uh a little stalls where they sell uh souvenirs like during the new year they sell we~ decorations for chinese new year
this would be the closest to a bazaar
you want- okay you want pictures of the shops let me see if i can get it for you
i've been doing it for more than twenty years
yes
when i first did chinatown we had a street side fortune tellers but they are gone now
uh they are- you know that we spruced up chinatown that's why if you're worried about anything all the buildings are very clean they have been conserved so they look uh new but in fact they are from the eighteen hundreds
so here you see the lanterns decorating the street side for the lunar new year which is around february
but at this time that you uh you can also buy things along chinatown but you won't have to jostle with people it will be more comfortable for you
uh yes
so here you can see you can get your post cards
you-
can you see a little chinese costumes if i'm not mistaken for your uh daughter
no no they are not expensive at all
in fact some of them when they hang big signs outside their stalls uh usually i don't bargain because they are already telling you that this is a bargain
yes you can get one for yourself and for your daughter as well
a lot of tourists do that because they can wear their souvenir
okay
the little dragon there you can use it to decorate your home
very colour~ ye~ yes
uh they- during the chinese new year period before the chinese new year we get a lot of shop selling these decorations
this- the brown things
if i'm not mistaken this is a dried gourd g o u r d it is a fruit like a melon that is dried up and when it's dried it hardens and they dig out the centre

hello
good morning
hi eric
my name is jeanne
i'm fine
i'm fine
how can i help you eric
formula one is in september
formula one is in september
uh usually i think the third week of september
all by yourself just to watch formula one
okay
okay
so it's uh- the races would be friday saturday and sunday usually
two days means you wants only one night in singapore
two days means you wants only one night in singapore
oh okay
so one night
yes
then you'll have lots of money for your ticket
uh you don't want to visit anywhere else in singapore
and save yourself for the race
let me see the- sorry
you can buy the ticket for the two days
uh let me see
yah
the ticket price just a minute
uh early bird tickets you can buy it would be a big cheaper if you are sure to be coming
so you still qualify for the early bird race uh purchase
can you see
oh i'm afraid it's a minimum of four tickets
yah one to three tickets are thousand dollars
uh wait let me see
you can buy at places that are not so premium for watching
the bay grandstand
the bay grandstand you get a view of the- okay let me tell you the difference
you would be able to see maybe a longer stretch of them racing
starting line i'm not very sure where they start the race
let me try and find out for you
uh but let me have a look at the tickets first huh
okay
i think it's the waterfront grandstand if i'm not mistaken
i cannot remember exactly
but for your tickets uh if you buy one ticket at bay grandstand it's only about two hundred and fifty dollars
let me see
oh it doesn't- three da~ it's a three-day ticket category
and you- so you can actually come in one day earlier and watch all you know the yes three days
okay
maybe we can find out from here where they start uh the race
maybe we can find out from here where they start uh the race
yes
so the race starts at the pit here
so the race starts at the pit here
can you see
that's right
the one at the waterfront bay is here
and the race continues down and this is the padang
so there is another padang uh stand tickets
that's the one that is two hundred over dollars i believe
that's the one that is two hundred over dollars i believe
one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars
one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars
straight line yes
but you get a very good view of the drivers you know
i don't think they overtake at those corners
if i was a driver that's what i would do
i'm not sure what they would do um-
yes
it's two hundred and forty eight
so you can say it's about two hundred and fifty dollars
because this is uh billed through sistic
it should include i mean if they put in taxes it will be a odd figure with a few cents
it does
because it- there is no exclusion that taxes are not included
oh yes
you'll have lots of money to shop because you're staying only one night
uh do you want to stay in a nice hotel in chinatown
uh do you want to stay in a nice hotel in chinatown
more pocket money for shopping
more pocket money for shopping
that's not very comfortable right for twenty dollars
that's not very comfortable right for twenty dollars
you have a lot of money left over for shopping
uh or do you want to just have a room that is not so expensive
uh or do you want to just have a room that is not so expensive
maybe around hundred dollars
maybe around hundred dollars
oh all our hostels are safe
even our backpackers joints are safe
they have been checked over
and usually you'll have lockers
uh okay
uh and you don't mind if uh you have outside bathrooms and uh- the places i've checked out before they- on the pictures they look very clean
oh yes
if you are having a room definitely
and even the backpackers joints they have air conditioning
because here we are rather warm and humid
because here we are rather warm and humid
and if you are serious about coming i suggest you book the rooms straightaway because at that time uh the rooms run out very fast
so just give us a moment
if you book now in fact i think you can get your room
uh the category that you want a little bit easier
if you book-
uh nowadays the hotels know that this is a peak period
so i don't think you'll get a discount
um in the regular hotels in fact you'll have to pay more like in the first class hotels uh they charge more
okay
do you want to see our rooms first
we are trying to uh find out
okay
let me see whether we can get a picture of this- whether they have rooms for you because it says twenty eight dollars which would not be a room i think
but uh-
they have- uh let's see if they have- they usually show the lowest price
see they have- oh no oh can you see that it's a mix dorm
can you see on your pre~ screen
so that would be six-bed mix dorm
and uh it's thirty three dollars a night
single room for under fifty dollars i think that's a bit tough
uh that's a bit tough
closer to a hundred dollars you might be able to get a room uh of your own
oh so if you spent- uh oh you mean if you s~ your ticket is two hundred and fifty dollars you have seven hundred and fifty dollars left
that's- wow
two hundred and fifty dollars will get you a hotel room
uh okay
let me try and find one for you
you don't really need two hundred and fifty dollars
so let's say less than a hundred dollars
so let's say less than a hundred dollars
so- okay this one- little india is actually not less than a hundred
but this is a good hotel here
it's a hundred and fifty eight
can you see
fortuna hotel
this is in little india
this is in little india
it's a good area
it's a good area
then we have budget class
uh the first two that states little india you are very near to town and you can get to your race very easily by the trains
the ones that say "geylang" are too far away
oh if you do that you will bust your budget
uh because if you- the hotel rates will go up during that time for the budget class hotels
so-
even though you book in advan~ no even though you book in advance
and they also have to pay a small fee as a tax
uh so they bill it into the room rates
so i think your priority to- is to book your hotel first and- or tickets
then you have tide in your cost for your trip
you know the two important things for you and the rest of it you can use for shopping
so this is a good hotel
can you see uh the one that's hundred and fifty five dollars
can you see uh the one that's hundred and fifty five dollars
uh santa grand hotel bugis
it's also just one stop away from the race venue
it's in a shopping area
it's in a shopping area
it's also fairly new
it's also fairly new
uh one or two stars
yah we don't go by the star system in singapore because it's too restrictive on pricing
but maybe i would call it two-star
uh lavender street
let me see
beach hotel you can also walk to the race area
hundred and thirty dollars
hundred and thirty dollars
uh broadway hotel is in little india
you can take a train
that's a hundred dollars
you'll save some money
it's okay if you take just one stop
uh and in fact for one stop i think you can walk
i'm assuming you're quite young right
yes
so uh that's not a problem
and there are also maybe traffic jams and uh- because there is road closure uh for where the races run
so traffic is diverted
i mean i would walk it
but uh there may not be buses there
if it's diverted it will affect the bus route also
so you might as well walk
so you might as well walk
yes
that's right
so you can take the- uh beach hotel then you walk
or you can take uh broadway hotel that's in little india
it's quite interesting uh because- well if you don't go anywhere you just walk around the area
it's quite interesting uh because- well if you don't go anywhere you just walk around the area
uh lots of things to see hindu temples
uh are you bringing your camera
so you can in the early morning uh when you are not involved in the- watching the races you can uh take photographs of the uh people going there to shop the people praying in the hindu temples the flower garland makers
so you can do you know things that tourist normally do
you'll get a lots of souvenir photographs when you go home
what we had-
uh some of them do some of them don't
you can eat at the little cafes
and if you're vegetarian lots of vegetarian food
if you want some- do you eat indian food
uh so you can get north indian which is less spicy
you can get south indian if you like your curries hot
you can have vegetarian and it would be just a few dollars
yes
i think under five dollars would be more than enough
i think under five dollars would be more than enough
if you pay for the breakfast in the hotel i believe they would cost-
they would cost you in a higher- cost you more and then they put in a buffet spread you know jam and eggs and ham and you know the stuff that uh hotels normally provide
so- yes you will
so here
let me see was it hun~ did it say a hundred dollars- hundred and forty here it says
so single without breakfast right up to december is a hundred and forty dollars
yes
that's right
if you have two days then you uh little bit more relax you know
after you have landed and you have a bit more time to sightsee
so two fifty for the tickets another two hundred and eighty for your two nights right
so you have four hundred and seventy dollars left to spend
if you- what are you looking for in shopping
but there's a centre i will recommend you to
it's uh an it centre
it's uh an it centre
and what i normally advice people to do is to go around the stores
and what i normally advice people to do is to go around the stores
be honest and tell them you are checking prices and you'll come back if they are giving you a good deal
be honest and tell them you are checking prices and you'll come back if they are giving you a good deal
yes
uh in fact if you ask me i think little india looks like a flea market with all the stalls filling out into the street
but you can go to a place called bugis where we have a little lane and there are lots of little stalls selling very low priced um souvenirs
uh one of the souvenirs that should people normally buy is of the merlion uh sort of- uh just an ornament to put on the table
uh one of the souvenirs that should people normally buy is of the merlion uh sort of- uh just an ornament to put on the table
uh depends on the size of the item
uh depends on the size of the item
they have them really small for people who want tiny things
so if you go to a good class store it might cost you fifteen twenty dollars
so if you go to a good class store it might cost you fifteen twenty dollars
if you buy it on the street side i think would be two three dollars you should be able to get it
if you buy it on the street side i think would be two three dollars you should be able to get it
it's not expensive
it's not expensive
now here you ca-
so here is an air conditioned area uh within a shopping mall that is next to a hotel in the same district of bugis
and what we've done is we've conserved the old buildings
can you see the windows here
uh no this is- well there is food all around
but here it seems to be having a food fair
so that i think that was when it was photographed
so that i think that was when it was photographed
but generally they have stalls selling a whole lot of things
if you want to buy uh scarfs for your girlfriend you want to buy handbags or you want to buy uh like you say souvenirs
you can get them here
so if you think it's too hot and you want somewhere air conditioned you can shop in here
but just opposite is the lane where you uh have shops on your left and right
and you have a whole range of items from uh t-shirts that young people like to wear uh and uh even buddha statues uh cd's even at times
and this is some of the food you can eat
well do you like curry
or you prefer something that is not so hot
okay
here can you see the stall here on your left
can you see the ch~ no that's chicken
very fat chicken
and right at the end of the brown bird you can see a pale white one
uh at these stalls you usually can get two kinds uh roasted or you can get it a normal chicken rice
and so uh the chicken is boiled and then the soup that is used to boil the chicken is used to cook the rice
and in the rice they tie up pandan leaves to give the rice fragrance
and they add a little bit of oil so the rice in itself in fact when i was a child i used to eat a lot of just the rice
we pour thick black sauce over it
and if you like to have it hot then you take a vinegarish chili
the chili is ground with um a little bit of vinegar sauce
and the chicken is very delicious
you can also eat
yes
and then you get a soup
the soup comes free of charge
uh sometimes they have a fix deal three dollars a plate
uh sometimes it's two dollars
but i think two dollars will not be enough for you
and also the cuts of meat you know
if you want to have the thigh of the chicken which is very popular maybe you have to pay three fifty
and some places- yah at fifty cents per rice
so if you like the rice and you say "i want another bowl of rice"
they will charge you another fifty cents
some- okay
um sometimes you know if you tell them "i don't want it so hot"
they will make it with a little bit less chili
if you want to save money for shopping then you go for the side street vendors
if you want to have uh to pamper yourself then you can eat at the restaurants
if you want to have uh to pamper yourself then you can eat at the restaurants
uh the dish i am recommending is chili crab
uh the dish i am recommending is chili crab
uh so- usually at the restaurants
and as you break up the crab they give you something to- they've smashed the crab a little bit so that you can get at the meat inside uh the shell
and then you uh- buns
can you see here at the description
served with steam deep fried buns
these are very nice and soft buns uh with nothing inside
yes
that's right
it's mantou that is uh usually served in chinese food
it's mantou that is uh usually served in chinese food
when i was young we uh just add it with plain white bread
so what- if you order this i suggest you just order this and don't order anything else
so you can eat the whole crab
uh yes
but this is a mantou with just a slice
and then it's empty
it's empty inside
so the idea is that instead of eating rice you use the mantou to wipe out the sauce and eat that
uh not so sweet
it's chili with uh sweet sauce so that the sweetness balances the chili
so it varies with the price of the crab
it could be maybe i would say not more than forty dollars
a whole crab yah
uh the thing is they sell it by the crab and they will weigh the crab
so it's alright if you go and ask how much they weight and you can walk away and say "no i don't want to take" you know
no uh i do it all the time
but uh as i said this dish is very nice if you have a few people to share
then you order things like vegetables
and let me see what do we have here
i can't recognise this dish
let's have a look at this
oh this is-
uh yah
clams steamed and they have mixed garlic
and it's a light dish
so this uh clams they actually looked like bamboo
that's why they're called bamboo clams
it varies with the restaurants
uh the- jumbo is a very popular restaurant and it's got a few branches
they have one restaurant which is very near to the f one uh race track
it's along the river
and so it's very convenient for you
uh but if they raise prices it would be you know on the menu or they would be assigned to tell you
they wouldn't suddenly give you a bill you know that is higher than what's on the menu
so you can see- can you see a view of the restaurant
it's a nice place
yes
that is the river which is right next to the f one uh race track
and it opens out into the marina bay which is now our reservoir
uh which collects rainwater that falls in the city
so you know the ambiance is very nice
you just have to look at the menu before you order and ask them to weigh the crab
and that you don't have to eat the crab if you don't like
you can have steamed prawns
you can have a fish
uh generally in singapore the fish and crabs and prawns uh would be the higher price items
if you are vegetarian it's much cheaper to eat
if you buy it from the street vendors uh you are getting more singaporean taste
you know what i mean
um you are getting what i would be eating without busting my budget
um you are getting what i would be eating without busting my budget
if you go into the restaurants you are getting sometimes it is modified to the taste of the tourist
that means the chili maybe a little bit left out
uh if you are buying off the street you can ask them-
when they can they will reduce it for you
when they can they will reduce it for you
but otherwise for two dollars or three dollars they will give you what they have
the vendors in little india are very accommodating
the vendors in little india are very accommodating
they're very friendly
so i eat there quite often
and you would obviously look like a tourist
four hundred dollars to spend
uh or to shop
to spend that's a lot of money
i don't spend that much in a week
uh it's-
yah
no that's a lot of money in singapore
yes for food
yes for food
you can even eat your crab
and you can eat street food also
you don't want to blow it all on restaurants right
so in little india if you eat in the little cafes uh it will cost you uh ten dollars if you order more than one dish
if you will order- yah
if you walk in uh there's a little indian restaurant opposite a hindu temple
the road is called veerasamy road
i don't think they are on the internet
but they will have different uh vegetarian like pancakes cooked with unions uh cooked with potatoes inside
they're just between one dollar and maybe two fifty
that's all
so it's not expensive
ethnic food would be the food you get in little india
in chinatown would be the chinese food
in chinatown would be the chinese food
and the chili crab also
um during chinese new year we have another one
it's called yusheng that we tossup
it's a salad that we eat
and that's also singaporean
but that's normally you get it when you come before the lunar new year
but that's normally you get it when you come before the lunar new year
no they serving that
because it's superstitious when we eat that as we add the ingredients and we toss it up
it's very nice
uh you've got to come before the new year because during the chinese new year some of the restaurants maybe closed for the first day or the second day to give their staff a break
uh you have to check the chinese calendar
so it changes because it's not a gregorian calendar
so it changes because it's not a gregorian calendar
okay
you want to-
you wanted to uh buy some uh computer peripherals
is that right
you were mentioned it just now
okay
let me show you funan centre first
it's a mall
it's- uh when it's open it's dedicated to computer items
information technology shops
and can you see city hall there
it is in the area but uh city hall and the supreme court right now they are molded up uh for the- uh they are no longer functioning as uh court or government officers but they are gonna be turn into one big uh museum and art gallery
it wouldn't look so nice
so if you look at the padang
can you see connaught drive
sort of where the word singapore is
sort of where the word singapore is
and behind it would be funan mall
so your computer shops are there
and then if you have time at night you can walk along uh the river
you- can see you a little blue curvy line
that's our historic river
and there are- okay
yes so do you see boat quay
yes so do you see boat quay
yes so do you see boat quay
yes so do you see boat quay
it's on the opposite banks of uh the hill street area where the road name is shown
so can you see uh merchant road
so before merchant road it's right along the river
if you walk along it you cannot miss it
it's a short walk
i walk much more than that every time i'm in the area
if you walk fast just five minutes
otherwise if you are looking at things which i presume you will be doing maybe ten minutes
there is also an interesting museum just behind um where you see the boat quay name
can you see
so across the river from there is the asian civilisation's museum
and you can visit that too
oh i don't know about the history channel
uh this museum shows you the early history of singapore in the front foyer
and uh-
that's the old british office that used to be a government office
let me get it for you
uh not inside the exhibits there
because uh i think one is for security reasons and sometimes people forget to switch off their flash and you would fade the exhibits
so for some of the exhibits it's actually a little bit dim
so we have an exhibit on south asia that would be india
we have one there you see some of the statues that we have on display
yes but you check with the security before you enter uh just to be sure yah
yes but you check with the security before you enter uh just to be sure yah
um we have an southeast asian exhibit
uh this is my favourite
it's west asia
if you like you can also visit this museum the peranakan museum which is also nearby
uh for the asian civilisation's museum the outside area that shows you the singapore history and the history of the river that one- that one is uh free of charge
so if you go too late and you think you have no time uh then i suggest you go to visit just the outside area and you can take photographs from there into the river
okay
can you see this picture here
so the acm is here
so the acm is here
your um seats for watching the f one is where the cricket club is just around the corner
so walking distance and your uh rice chicken- uh sorry your chili crab is down boat quay just a little bit further down
let me see if i can get the prices for you
i know it's ten dollars only
yes
it shouldn't be more than ten dollars in fact eight dollars
okay
very affordable
very affordable
yes
there is a museum shop but uh the souvenirs are very good quality
uh although they do have certain items on sale now and then
uh and then you can buy your computer it products from funan centre
four hundred dollars is a lot of money
you can eat your chili crab
yes uh-
yes
uh the indian restaurants there um in little india
uh the indian restaurants there um in little india
so-
if you take the one-
yes
if you take the one in little india you have to take a train
yes
do you want to see a map of the uh train
the so~
'cause i think i haven't shown you that right
it goes by distance
so it depends on how far you travel
and from what you have planned it's not very far
and from what you have planned it's not very far
so uh maybe the longest distance would be from the airport to the city
so you get your ticket from the basement of changi airport
yah
okay that's station number three
okay that's station number three
you take it to tanah merah
and you have to get off and switch on a train that goes westwards
and when you go down westwards you travel down
if you are going to book into the hotel in little india you switch- you- i think you go all the way down to outram park that would be easier
and then you get off and get on what we call the north east line which is purple
can you see the purple line
so that's outram park very near to chinatown
you turn north east
there are hotels also in chinatown but you can carry on to little india
that would be maybe your most expensive ride hm under three dollars singapore money
yes
and the rest of your rides would be from little india uh down to- if you want to go to chinatown it's two stops
you can also stop at clarke quay which is uh-
yah it's the river
yes
and you could walk from clarke quay uh to the f one sites
uh and also to where you eat
yes
so when you take photographs you have the bay in your background
so when you take photographs you have the bay in your background
um and when you walk around you can see the marina bay sands which is one of our two um integrated resorts
um and when you walk around you can see the marina bay sands which is one of our two um integrated resorts
you switch to city hall station
and that's also in the area
for your- well i call it a show for the f one race
it's- part of it is above ground
and then it goes underground because that area is built-up
and in the chinatown area it is all uh built-up so it is underground
but when you go out of the city it is above ground for some parts
uh the purple line is mostly underground
almost all of singapore
but it's also integrated with a bus system
so for example uh at paya lebar where you have an interchange there are lots of buses there to cover areas not covered by the mrt
so for example uh at paya lebar where you have an interchange there are lots of buses there to cover areas not covered by the mrt
at dhoby ghaut there are lots of buses as well and at city hall
we also have a bus information board behind where you sit you can read off and find information
where about- you know where the buses would bring you to
it follows a strict schedule but we can't control the traffic
hm sometimes we grumble because the same bus number comes- two of the buses come together
but it's not the fault of the driver or the scheduler
it's because of the traffic
no that- it's not twenty four hours
for the f one they would be extended for sure
uh they would publicize it that they would extend it maybe for an hour or two
because they know a lot of people need to get home and so they need to provide the uh transportation
we also have a night rider system where the buses bring people from areas like uh chinatown uh the night clubbing areas back into the major cities
this is more to service singaporeans who have a night out and you know they don't drive
the- uh unsafe area
so if you do that you probably might invite trouble
uh one place that's a bit shady is called geylang
but to me it's very colourful
i have been there
it's uh- we have some- let me see if i can get you pictures there
it is a little bit out of the way
uh you get authentic food there
okay
uh i hope you will come and remember to buy your tickets early so that you can uh enjoy the cheaper rate for the hotel before it gets filled up
okay
alright
you don't want to wait for the picture of geylang
no
alright then
goodbye
thank you
bye eric
bye
hello
guide number two
how are you maggie
i'm fine too
i'm fine too
how can i help you maggie
you want to bring your dog
did you say
i'm afraid you can't do that because your dog will have to be quarantined
yes
so um if you bring it in your dog will still not be with you
so um if you bring it in your dog will still not be with you
he will be put in quarantine
he will be put in quarantine
you cannot carry your dog with you in the hotel and bring it into singapore
yes
you have to find someone to babysit
one-
one week
uh what is your uh intention
so you want to save money for shopping
okay
or rather the lowest priced rooms that you can get
is that it
is that it
oh you like a bit of luxury
we will look for it and see whether we can uh accommodate you
we will look for it and see whether we can uh accommodate you
but how much money are you going to spend
but how much money are you going to spend
is that for yourself
is your boyfriend sharing uh like he's gonna put in another thousand
let me see if i can get you uh rooms
because you really- you don't want dormitory
because you really- you don't want dormitory
you also want to have uh a room right
you also want to have uh a room right
so-
oh so that's not really backpacker right
that would be a hotel
uh not a very high price hotel
okay
let me see
what is your interest
what is your interest
uh anything else
okay
oh yes of course
then there are lots of shops all over singapore
okay
here are some hotels here
we have to look at your budget
le~ let's look at under a hundred
well at- what is shown here this one at eighty-five
it's a bit high price
i mean sorry
it's a bit low price but it's uh bit out of the way
uh it is in what- some of us considered a little shady part of singapore
full of colour actually
i think with your boyfriend it should be okay
but you have to walk a little distance to where the trains are
uh if you're in town this is a bit better
yes uh-
now you- if you look at the screen there are hotels
the keong saik hotel at ninety dollars
uh race course road is uh in little india and it's eighty dollars
uh race course road is uh in little india and it's eighty dollars
so what is your preference to be
in an area where you can get out and get chinese food
in an area where you can get out and get chinese food
or where you can get indian food easily
or where you can get indian food easily
uh if you stay in chinatown
you are closer to places like uh museums
you are closer to places like uh museums
and some of the train stations
and you can also get indian food in chinatown
and it's only a short distance
two to three stops through little india
where you can choose from a whole variety of indian food
yes that's right
keong saik street
uh ninety dollars is actually a very good deal
because it's right in town
uh and it is near the civic district which is our historic area and near the river
so very easy
okay
let's have a look here
so is- can you see
it's-
wi-fi
it doesn't say wi-fi right
do i see wi-fi
do i see wi-fi
no i don't se-
we have internet access here
can you see
it's very good
can you see it won in a ha~ architectural heritage award
yes that- that means the building is a pretty building
yes that- that means the building is a pretty building
okay
okay just a minute
i'm trying to get you a bigger picture of it
it's in a conservation area
so they would maybe late eighteen hundreds or early nineteen hundreds
i'm not very clear on the exact date
but they have been totally refurbished and redone
so they got an award because they have done it sensibly
so they got an award because they have done it sensibly
so you are in uh one of my favourite districts with all these history around you
and yet you have clean rooms
you have uh the convenience of uh shopping just outside
food
so i will-
show you where it is
okay
i will show you on the map in a little while
there is a stop on the trains
but you will have to change trains
which i think is not a problem for you
right
and it is uh a mixture of above ground and below ground
yes
and there is uh two stops that will bring you near here
one is the outram park
the other one is on the other side and it's called chinatown
so you can just walk to where your hotel is
so you can just walk to where your hotel is
there are other hostels in the other side lanes
where we have food stalls and souvenir shops
where we have food stalls and souvenir shops
so this is a nice lane
uh that used to be a red light district but no more
no it' s not a red light district at all
uh not really only for tourist
for locals as well
it's just the hotels are aim at the tourist
uh but the food and the uh- i mean singaporeans visit the place
you will know when you visit there
you'll see a lot of locals shopping eating
so uh you soak in the atmosphere
they would understand english
if you speak slowly
and if you are negotiating prices
what i do when i visit uh some other countries is that i bring a calculator
what i do when i visit uh some other countries is that i bring a calculator
yes
and so that's because you don't want them to misunderstand you
so it should not be a problem
you may have problem understanding them
because we speak singlish
we combined english with chinese grammar
singlish
yes
singapore english
okay
no singlish uh
the- yes uh uh
uh yes uh but if i went to chinatown
uh because i adopt what people are telling me
so uh singlish for example why you're so like that
do you understand me
we had uh singer composer who is very popular
who composed songs and music with using singlish
uh occasionally we've got malay words thrown in
but uh it is very local
uh that will leave you a lot of money for shopping if you just- you see if you spend two days ninety dollars you can spend two days right
yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
so you said you wanted animals
so-
yes
can i get you singapore wildlife safari or singapore wildlife reserves
the reserves is the uh governing body for the bird park the zoo and the night safari
and the zoo and night safari are next to each other
so i suggest you buy a ticket for all three attractions
and you could visit all three in a day or you could do two on one day
and spend a morning at the bird park and you have the afternoon free
uh when i get back to the screen i'll show you
it's on the west line and you'll just have to connect
and take a short bus ride there
yes
oh you can see the show and you can- when you enter you just get a leaflet
or if they have uh more specific brochure on the timings
the guest relation officers will advise you uh when are the feeding times
they usually put out bird food and fruits
very near to the pathway where you are walking
at feeding time if the keeper is there he will uh- you can buy let's say of just a few dollars for the bird feed
and you can either hold it up in your little plastic container
yes
uh can i show you the other attractions first and then i come to the pricing
so this is the bird park
so this is at a different location from where the zoo and the night safari are located
uh because the zoo and night safari are just next door to each other
so if we look at the zoo
yes so i suggest to- because the night safari opens at seven
the same day
so you just walk across
that's uh a new nudist
uh it is a mole rat
yes
and it doesn't have any hair
so that's why they called it a nudist uh colony
yes
but uh they will not be in your face you know
um it's optional whether- uh in fact i don't think you will be able to handle the mole rats
uh you- uh at the night safari yea i'm gonna show you now
there is a show and you can- after the show they'll bring out some of the animals
if you like to handle a snake
if you like to handle a snake
well that might be an opportunity for you
well that might be an opportunity for you
uh only the ones that come out with the keepers
you- we won't let you introduce snake enclosure
um but they'll be able to find you after that
uh in the zoo that i showed you just now we have uh reptile enclosure that you can go in
but i think you leave your boyfriend outside
uh you can see the giraffes here
we just had a new baby born
and-
so if you walk fast and you are not too tired out you can take the tram ride
and after that do the walking trail
okay just uh maybe an hour if you walk slowly
because you say you like animals that would be fun right
safari animals like i said after the show they bring them out and you can handle them have your boyfriend take photos with you
uh the interaction in the daytime- in the day zoo so it's when you go for first with the orangutans
and that means you would go for the zoo visit for a whole day
you would stay for morning till afternoon
unless you take a break and journey to the bird park and comeback for the night safari
because at the breakfast time you have your breakfast the orangutans have their breakfast and then uh can go up and take photos with the orangutans
uh on the other hand um during the showtime also at the zoo
you can opt to buy food and feed the animals
the- the keepers will be there with the food
so it is actually managed by the keepers
they can't actually take out the cookies and feed the animals
yah
that's right
so do you want to know the ticket prices
let me show you the opening hours and the rates um so night safari
you are only allowed in after dark
can you see seven-thirty to twelve
so you-
and so there is a price saving
can you see here thirty-two dollars admission and tram
uh just a minute
have a look at this chart here
it's only forty-two dollars
it's only forty-two dollars
so you get a big discount
so you get a big discount
uh so if you are visiting the bird park as well
you'll pay fifty-eight dollars
and that same ticket you'll visit all three attractions
normally you would have thirty days to use up the ticket
normally you would have thirty days to use up the ticket
so in your two days for sure you would use it up within the thirty-day limit
so in your two days for sure you would use it up within the thirty-day limit
no you can use it on separate days
as long as it's within thirty days of the time you buy it
so the first visit whether it's a bird park zoo or night safari you can buy this ticket
so for the three-in-one at any of these parks you buy the ticket and you make sure you keep the ticket
so they have the date on the ticket
and they will tear off which ever portion they want for your visit
yah that's the best deal
it includes taxes
uh you are not a senior citizen so you don't get the-
right
so that would be a hundred and twenty dollars
so that would be a hundred and twenty dollars
correct
and you've on~
you've only spend three hundred dollars of your thousand dollars
shopping areas
okay
shopping areas
okay just a moment
so we are sending you to the uh centre of the shopping area called orchard road
so you move from a place to place and uh where it's exposed is just a little area
so it's not very hot even if you walk
so- uh no the underpasses yes it's quite recent
and uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it
and uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it
so that they can you know don't have to negotiate traffic light junctions
and it's a seamless travel from place to place
so here you're seeing some of the scenes
this is the little road off the main road
we have bus and eating places alfresco
behind there are also um uh restaurants in- usually besides alfresco you have also um indoor dining areas
so you can shop and eat and shop and eat
uh you are looking at some of the high end brands here
less upscale
okay
uh you are in chinatown
so i suggest you shop in chinatown for your gifts
if you have to buy lots and lots of gifts
chinatown would be the place
and you can do a bit of bargaining but usually the prices are very good
just give me a moment to show you the street scene
where you can buy off the stalls uh that are in front of the shops
where you can buy off the stalls uh that are in front of the shops
so prices are attractive
they would hang out signs like any three items for ten singapore dollars
they would hang out signs like any three items for ten singapore dollars
or if you buy one it's two dollars
if you buy three it's five dollars
if you buy three it's five dollars
yes
it's not a wholesale thing
it is more uh ap~ an offer to attract you to buy more than one item
so you get to uh- let's say a fan and uh chopsticks
it might be a mixed things or it might be just fan
so if you buy one fan for instance maybe two dollars but if they would say "oh if you buy six we'll give it to you for ten dollars"
so if you buy one fan for instance maybe two dollars but if they would say "oh if you buy six we'll give it to you for ten dollars"
so they don't consider themselves uh wholesale
it's just uh a gimmick
because they know it's within the budget of tourists
it attracts me as well
so sometime- when i travel i buy some of these things to giveaway to people
uh uh yes
uh when you know it's nice to give something to people when you are away also
so here something singapore
you can get uh fans
that are printed with pretty flowers
and you might want to bring one along
so that you can fan yourself as you are shopping
and you can also get chopsticks
wel- yes
uh we have the chinese medicinal shops that sell chinese herbs
and they will even prescribe for you if you have a particular ailment
so give me a moment
you can see um broadly the street view
yes
it's at the place called sago lane
and it's right next to a big buddhist temple called buddha tooth relic temple which you can also visit if you wish
oh yes
it's within walking distance
maybe ten minutes if you walk slowly
maybe ten minutes if you walk slowly
this part of chinatown is a little bit busier and has more traffic
your side of where your hotel is it's quieter
your side of where your hotel is it's quieter
as- yap
so that's uh- that's nice because you can walk and see these things but you can go back to the quiet peaceful part of your hotel
yes beaches
i suggest you go to sentosa island
you're just interested in swimming right
okay spas
there are in chinatown
and they might have offers for you
uh generally they charge about ninety-eight dollars
uh generally they charge about ninety-eight dollars
but sometimes they go for sixty-eight and even less than that
uh they give you offers
so that you will sign up as a member
but uh as a tourist maybe uh- no these spas here um more the upperscale ones
i think the ones in chinatown are good
i think the ones in chinatown are good
you can also go again for what we called with foot reflexology
you can also go again for what we called with foot reflexology
yes so every both days you can go
yes so every both days you can go
it's not expensive
it's about maybe- it depends on the time you take it from twenty to thirty dollars according to how long
okay let me show you beaches
yes
and it -
yes
uh and we'll be have museums there
but the beach you see it's nice and sandy
you can also eat there
there are- there's uh inexpensive like a food court where you have a variety of food
where that you can order from
and of~ okay
can i show you the map on the mrt on the print system
okay
uh when you come in from the airport and you at number three
and i'll come- i'll talk about the train system later
you follow the green line
and it's easier if you could take it all the way to outram park
and then you switch to the northeast line
that's right
uh well i count in time of minutes
uh well i count in time of minutes
maybe ten minutes or so
maybe ten minutes or so
very close
you take the same line
the purple line
and you go just two stops to harbourfront
and there are two ways you can go into sentosa
you can cross the road and take a light trail which is at the upper level of a big shopping centre
so you walk from-
you just have to walk a short distance when you come out of the train station
you just have to walk a short distance when you come out of the train station
you follow the signals to say that it goes to the bus terminals
and just behind- can you see behind harbourfront here on the right-hand side
it's not shown but there's a big bus terminals
and the sentosa shuttle occupies uh two bus lots
very near to the- where you will be
you just wait for the bus
there will be someone there uh to guide you
and the bus will be marked sentosa
so you take it and it brings you straight in
yes on the island the same bus
so what you pay is just two dollars to enter the island
and one dollar for the bus fare
and one dollar for the bus fare
so when you come out of the island it's free of charge
so when you come out of the island it's free of charge
in other words they collect it when you enter
and then they don't collect anymore when you come out
and then they don't collect anymore when you come out
i think the beach is quite near or you can- if the beach is not near you can just take a shuttle to near the beach
they are internal shuttles within sentosa
i have uh brochure of it
and sentosa island uh siloso beach
there are three beaches along sentosa
so-
yes or could walk the whole distance from end to end
and have a-
when you reached sentosa
uh you can take shuttle buses
so can you see getting there the different coloured lines
blue red and green
so uh these are the buses that fly to different areas in sentosa
and there also a beach tram that you can take
if you just want to have a fun ride on the beach tram you wait for it
it's very popular
uh there are-
this is actually the beach
so you're on the beach
you're subject to the weather and the waves
it's very natural
it's not uh an artificial environment
huh
if you want something exciting uh do you know how the ski on the water attached to lines
do you do things like that
uh water skiing
no not in sentosa it's on the east coast of singapore
um i forgot the name
uh it's- you have to be able to swim quite well
uh because the line brings you down into the water and you are held up by the line
yah let me see if i can get it on east coast parkway
this is what- oh if you want to wakeboard
uh we have a reservoir it is called the uh bedok
uh we have a reservoir it is called the uh bedok
there you go wakeboarding
there you go wakeboarding
it's not the sea
it's a reservoir
uh we don't have sharks in singapore
uh we don't have sharks in singapore
uh don't mind actually it will be fun
we don't see some- we see dolphins occasionally
then you get to see uh the dolphins
uh yes i have uh of- near to changi actually
and it was a tourist who said to me "did you see the dolphin"
i said "i thought i saw a little bit but i thought it was screaming"
but he saw it
so it must have been real
that's right
uh we get turtles landing on our beach occasionally
um you can't really see it because we find them accidentally
and then what happens is the public will inform underwater world which is on sentosa
and then what happens is the public will inform underwater world which is on sentosa
it's a lovely aquarium
it's a lovely aquarium
and-
you want to see the aquarium
you want to see the aquarium
uh underwater world sentosa okay
yes that is separate
yes that is separate
so you would cover this on the same day you go the beach
okay
can you see this
here instead of diving
yah uh i'm trying to-
just give us a moment
so what happened is let me described it to you
so what happened is let me described it to you
you see uh marine fishes which are very colorful
you see uh marine fishes which are very colorful
the ones in the tropics
and you'll see them in- displayed in uh like an aquarium environment
but you also get underground where there is a whole aquarium around you
but you also get underground where there is a whole aquarium around you
and it's like you are on display to the fishes
yes that's right
and there are signboards at the side to show you
you know usually what's animal- uh what species is there they will display it
you know usually what's animal- uh what species is there they will display it
and there's also attached to this aquarium uh dolphin show
so we have sharks
you can even see baby sharks that are in the process of being uh hatched you know from the eggs
in the show you are seeing here there's a dolphin interacting
uh you will just pay a little fee and it will get a little bit wet
you don't have to go all the way in
but you can go down shake hands with the- no not suppose-
okay uh underwater world
okay uh underwater world
uh this is if you dive
okay a hundred and twenty dollars if you actually bring your diving suit and dive
and if you swim a hundred and seventy
and if you swim a hundred and seventy
yes
uh no the sharks you don't get to swim to do anything with them
uh so that's- that no it's a very safe environment here in the singapore
we don't expose tourists to any risk
we don't expose tourists to any risk
and we think dolphins are pretty friendly
uh so if you are prepared then you need to bring your swimming costume
you have money left over
can you see fish reflexology
you put your fish- uh put your feet
sorry into uh a very shallow uh something like a pool where they have tiny little fishes that nibble away at you- the dead skin of your- soles of your feet and all that
yes it's- uh i tried it
it's a little bit ticklish
so some people enjoy it
um but it's fun
pardon
oh no it's not painful at all
and it's uh quite popular
so you sit around and you can all laughter at each other
uh because some fish will maybe prefer a certain foot more than the other's
yes uh so uh we don't have much time
uh hm that's very good
so you can um have shopping money and you can apportion some of it to uh maybe a treat for yourself
and then the rest to uh souvenirs that you want to buy for friends to bring back
okay
so you're comfortable taking the trains you take the ez-link ticket from the basement of the airport
you pay and deposit for the price you gonna spend
and then you can get your refund before you leave singapore
your welcome
i hope i do see you in singapore
fish spa yes
okay right
okay
welcome
bye
hello
uh number thirteen
uh number thirteen
how do you spell your name
is it d o d y
is it d o d y
oh d o d i e and your number three zero is that right
uh huh dodie
how can i help you dodie
yes of course
yes of course
you need to- first you sound like a young man are you
uh how many people will be travelling with you
uh how many people will be travelling with you
okay
okay
uh when are you intending to travel
that's the easter weekend right
that's the easter weekend right
can you give me the exact dates of arrival and departure
okay
uh what are your interest
okay
so you do~ you would like to watch a game in process uh while you are in singapore and also visit some attractions is that right
okay first uh maybe we select a hotel for you and uh i show you a map of singapore and so you know what's the location of uh the various places
this is um- when you come in from the airport-
when you come in from the airport you will land at changi airport which is in the eastern side of singapore
when you come in from the airport you will land at changi airport which is in the eastern side of singapore
you know singapore isn't very large
seven hundred square kilometres
so this is a portion of the map that's interesting that is enlarged
uh do you see number three here at the right-hand side
uh that's the eastern corner of singapore
and the various colours you see are the lines for the mass rapid transit
uh so it shows you the connectivity
so from changi airport if you follow the green line down and you end at outram park you can go to the harbourfront which- and it's across from an island called sentosa just opposite
uh and if you go the other way you are into chinatown a little bit further up
dhoby ghaut is a major interchange where you see three little circles
so three lines pass through there
and so if you take the northeast- uh sorry the north-south line the red line you will reach orchard road which is a major shopping and tourist belt
uh sentosa uh has got many attractions
so you need not uh use up a lot of money if you for example see a show that's- and you don't buy the top end tickets and in fact if you only go to the beach it will cost you only three dollars
two dollars to go in one dollar for the bus shuttle
okay
first uh can i- you want me to pick you a hotel first
uh if you stay in chinatown you can get to harbourfront and you can get to the island very quickly
the hotels on the island would be a little bit pricier because they are you know normal hotels uh on resort islands
so uh of the top of per head about two hundred over dollars
in chinatown you can get them for around a hundred or even less
and you can also stay in the heritage area known as little india
to eat breakfast lunch or dinner or pick up a midnight snack lots of such food in little india and chinatown
uh if you are at on sentosa you probably have to go to the uh restaurants along the beach or eat at the hotels
so it will add to the cost
uh you don't really have to stay in chinatown
i'm just giving you choices
so if you stay in chinatown you've got more money to spend elsewhere
so back to our map here
uh when you land at changi airport uh at the basement is the train line uh station
and you go and see the officer and you buy what we call an ezlink card uh with a stored value and you can get a refund on the unused portion when you leave
and you go and see the officer and you buy what we call an ezlink card uh with a stored value and you can get a refund on the unused portion when you leave
so this would be a very fast and inexpensive way to get into town
a lots of tourist use it
s~ you would not be bringing a huge bag right
so uh you can-
yah that's right
so you take the train and the nice thing is it's above ground
so you're getting a better view than if you are say in a taxi or you know walking
anyway you wouldn't walk to town
it's a bit far
it goes above ground right up to kallang and then it goes under ground
so you take it down to outram park and then you can switch to the purple which is the northeast line
can you see it
and one-
yah one stop you are in chinatown
the- no you don't need to
um the stations will have signs and there will be an announcement on the trains before you get off
so you just you know prepare yourself when you are at tanjong pagar for instance
so you just you know prepare yourself when you are at tanjong pagar for instance
and then at outram park you get off- you don't get off the station you just walk up or down another level
and then you uh switch to the purple line
no it's the same uh system
it's just another name it's uh developed
so it makes it convenient
so it makes it convenient
an~ so you stay within the station
you're just going to another level and there will be many signs marked out
there'll also be people there willing to help you
you can ask anybody around you
they'll be able to point you the way
um if they cannot understand you they will give you a look- a blank look
and it could be a student from somewhere else or you know
uh someone whose not comfortable with english
but i think by the third time you ask someone should be able to ask- uh answer you
yes amazing race
yes amazing race
uh but uh i don't- is it on this weekend
because i don't know the programme
yes yes
i've seen it on tv
but uh they had a singapore sector
but i miss that
oh no- uh i am horrible with directions and i don't have a problem
you take the direction that goes towards punggol
can you see number seven on the top right inside
because you are going northeast
and then when you're going to sentosa you'll take the direction that says harbourfront
uh anyway when you buy your ticket you should be able to get a map from the airport
uh and if you need help from the officer he will tell you
anyway since you mentioned it
at uh the right-hand side of the map uh can you see the green line
so this is where you go westwards
yes
um and uh if you are not sure just ask anybody
any of them who use that stop they are the people who work at the airport and they will be able to advice you
any of them who use that stop they are the people who work at the airport and they will be able to advice you
no it's uh usually given free
no it's uh usually given free
and i think they have a large stock of it at the airport
s~ so you want hotels in uh chinatown right
okay i'll get you the hotels in chinatown first in singapore and then if- you see what sort of culture uh would you prefer around where you stay
is it chinese culture or indian culture
ah okay
and you can see we have a list of hotels here that are not very expensive
but uh decent hotels also
okay
so can you see a list of the prices there
uh if you want a quaint hotel uh with nice design hotel nineteen twenty-nine
all these hotels are- there's nothing murky or dirty about it because it's a conservation area
uh i'm not sure
if they did would probably uh sell a ghost tour there
no not that i know of
uh the- you want to stay in a ghost hotel
oh you are strange
uh it's called sago lane at the other end of chinatown
but it's about ten minutes away
uh the other hotel if you want to save money can you see the top hotel
keong saik yes
that's on the same street and uh i must tell you that this used to be a red-light district in my grandfather's time
but it's all been cleaned up and uh if you don't want to have too much-
uh to many people around your hotel this is the quieter side of chinatown
so you want me to show you this hotel
okay
i've been in this area- i've been in nineteen twenty-nine which invited travel agents and people in the- tour business to visit
but i think it looks okay
uh but uh you can see if there are any uh ratings on the hotel
uh huh
yes
yes it's very safe
uh it's very safe
you can find places to have uh supper
the shops around there might close around ten o'clock
but if you want to have a drink i would prefer you go down to the singapore river where the ambiance is uh by the singapore river
if you look at this uh picture of the hotel can you see the building up there
it won an architecture award in nineteen ninety-eight
which means it was restored just about- completely restored about four years ago
which means it was restored just about- completely restored about four years ago
and so it's quite new
i don't know ghosts uh previous occupants
o~ uh nineteen twenty-nine has a very good reputation because the developer is uh you know he develops small hotels
so let me try and find you nineteen twenty-nine
hotel nineteen twenty-nine- oh sorry
this hotel i actually went inside
i didn't stay here
i just visited it when they had built it and they invited us from the travel industry to go in
uh what is interesting i don't know if this will uh excite you is that they have a room the best room is in fact uh at the rooftop
uh what is interesting i don't know if this will uh excite you is that they have a room the best room is in fact uh at the rooftop
about 3 stories
but you see the rating here
is four stars
and if you'd- yah huh
if you take that room you can have a shower in the open uh with just you know like palm trees and plants uh just all around you
uh the hotel owner and the staff tell us they have done a check and nobody from the nearby skyscraper uh business buildings can actually see you
you don't want to risk it
you would not be afraid of this
you are actually surrounded
it's just the top you know what i mean
it's just the top you know what i mean
it's just the roof it's not there
okay then
then uh you can just take the suites
uh the one i'm talking about is the terrace suite
you can-
oh
a junior-
yup
i am not sure about that
uh i think they'd purposely put the the bathroom outside
that's supposed to be part of the thrill of staying in that room
okay
shall i show you the junior suite
first- yes the- okay
yes the deluxe is a double bed
it's very pretty isn't it
and you see you have your own wash basin here
it's like you know you are in your house
so the fittings and everything are- it's listed under budget but it's not really budget
i wouldn't call it uh budget
uh when they've opened it was fully booked for many months
hm it's a very popular on the internet
so your location would be chinatown
yes
that's right
so we gonna get you the rates now
okay
can you get it on the screen now
yes
so it's two hundred and ninety dollars
so it should be alri~ wait
let's have a look here
peak period surcharge will be applied uh must be done in seven days cancellation seven days prior to check-in
so there might be a small surcharge because it's the easter weekend
um activities at the museum
a lot of free activities you can enjoy uh but um we- for here for singapore easter is mainly a religious festival and a public holiday
uh yes it's solemn
but you can visit for example- uh are you catholic
um from where you are there are several catholic churches
um from where you are there are several catholic churches
and the ones that many people go to is the cathedral of the good shepherd
and since you are there you can also walk around and visit other churches uh within the area
so let me get it for you
the churches will be open
um if the church is shut because there is no service uh you just go to the back you know where the priest lives and if you tell them you are tourist they might even bring you on a tour around the place
yes
uh at the cathedral here we even have lunch time masses for people who go for daily mass during the lunch hour
uh at the cathedral here we even have lunch time masses for people who go for daily mass during the lunch hour
so this is a national monument and it is ones- just a few stops from uh your hotel
from chinatown
yes
uh can you see here eighteen thirty-two
uh many of the foreign community in singapore
uh they come here because of its good location
and you can see we even have a korean chaplin
and we have many filipinas who help with the choir or you know with um collecting donations for the poor
uh you see on the fourth sunday we have a tagalog mass
yes
uh for easter fo~ uh you are staying for good friday are you
it's not a problem
and in this vicinity we also have other churches
let me try and get for you
there's the saint joseph's church
actually i was going to introduce you to my church uh because i have a filipino choir
but they sing on saturday
so you won't get to see them
okay
saint joseph's church let me see huh
yes uh but i just you know back them up
yes uh but i just you know back them up
the filipinos do all the major singing
all the solos
many of our choirs we have a large proportion of the filipino community in singapore that support the choirs
yes
yes okay
this is very pretty and it's within walking distance of the cathedral
uh and here we've got many statues inside and the way of the cross uh along the walls
and- yes this is prettier uh and it's an earlier church
it was set-up by the portuguese mission that came but uh after that the french mission took over uh building of the churches
yes
and uh there's another one called saints peter and paul which is three minutes away from there
all of these are national monuments
they are protected
so they will be here even if you come back fifty years later
okay let me see
oh i should put in singapore
let me see whether i get- saints peter and paul in singapore
oh it's not a problem
the filipino choir do it all the time
uh we often have get togethers and uh somebody will donate some drinks for the party
because uh we take public transport so they don't have to worry about uh you know driving after drinking
so these churches i'm showing you they are within walking distance
um within this area we actually have the national museum
okay
okay
the public holiday
okay
this is about ten minutes from uh the churches
okay
walki~ yes
so the location of where the churches are and where the museum is it's a old historic area
can you see victoria street
so the churches are victo~ just pass victoria- around victoria street queen street
you just cross these little roads and across the road
is the national museum
so it's very convenient for you
uh if- there are lots of places you can eat around there
um you could go to raffles- what's the food are you looking for
so uh if you want to try new things without spending a lot of money there is a food court just near to where the churches are
and it's along bras basah road
uh the food court
let me see if it's called the republic foodcourt
it's a chain be- these food courts they are chains
just give us a moment
okay let me see
okay let me see
no the- it is not uh republic
okay can you see this
okay the first one item on the list-
okay the first one item on the list-
yah koufu
it's a chinese word
something to do with the mouth
something to do with the mouth
kou uh is a mouth
uh at the fu if it's the correct fu is means the good luck of the mouth
okay
so there you have it the explanation
so you can tell if i'm telling a lie
'cause i remember is it really good fortune
'cause i remember is it really good fortune
so on the left what you are seeing is what we have for breakfast a bun two eggs coffee or tea
so on the left what you are seeing is what we have for breakfast a bun two eggs coffee or tea
and then you can have uh- you know dimsum
yah dimsum is to touch the heart and you can try- there is a stall that sells uh variety of food
but at the food court it's interesting this one you know where the cathedral is that i recommended that you visit
uh we have a university it's called the smu and this is- this branch is at the basement of the smu
is-
i often eat there because the prices are reasonable and we even have the vietnamese stall we have an indian stall uh and we have a lots of chinese food
vietnamese
they uh- the vietnamese do a very good rice roll spring roll
you know if you are into healthy foods spring roll that is not fried but they use a special rice roll
the roll- the wrapper is made of rice
and so they have a lot of greens inside that it's very healthy
uh no it's not
it's like a spring roll except it doesn't have a crispy exterior
you know we believe that if you all eat all this fried foods you get a sore throat
so when you think you are feeling uh too much of the sun and you might get a sore throat then you go for this kind of food
so when you think you are feeling uh too much of the sun and you might get a sore throat then you go for this kind of food
it's easier on the throat
hm yes
there are- if you go to this food courts you can try a whole variety of food without spending a lot of money
lunch
uh better for lunch
uh better for lunch
because the students would be there during the day time
there is another food outlet that is uh opposite this a little bit further down the road towards the museum but uh opposite where this outlet is
and that would be open late
uh if you see- can you see bras basah here on the little map
so it's along the same road is just stretching down a little bit
uh and- okay
yes it's the same location
uh can you see bras basah road
yah you can see the koufu foodcourt
if you go for the up the road towards prinsep street
i can't remember the name but it's one of a chain in singapore and you also get variety of food there
so if you do the museum and then you want to have dinner nearby conveniently that's the place to go
so if you do the museum and then you want to have dinner nearby conveniently that's the place to go
yes
o~ okay
uh quite near to here and you can walk if you like or if you are too tired uh you can take may be two bus stops away is the singapore river
so i'm gonna suggest you go and walk along the river bank
so i'm trying to get it on the uh screen for you
uh if it's too hot you can move-in
yes
so it's quite scenic
uh it depends on the day
if it's been a hot day you will get uh- you might find it a bit warm
and then later in the evening you might find its nice
maybe at nine o'clock or ten o'clock
hum
i am not so up-to-date with music
but you can move along the various bars
they have a big tv screen
okay
uh you can start at boat quay and walk down towards clarke quay or you can visit the merlion by the singapore river
no the merlion is the emblem of singapore's uh tourism
no the merlion is the emblem of singapore's uh tourism
it's half lion head and half uh fish
because we were a fishing village
and a prince came along and thought he saw a lion
so he asked- actually he asked what it was and he was told it's a lion
can you see it now
uh sentosa has a huge merlion about twelve stories high
this is not so tall but it's a favourite place for you to take photographs
it's uh most tourists on their first visit would go there and uh photograph it
can you see it
it's on the screen now
so while you at facing boat quay if you walk left you get to the merlion
and so i think if it's early enough you might to want to take a photograph of the merlion first and then have your dinner along boat quay or clarke quay
and-
yes so it's just one bus ride from you know the bras basah road i showed you just now where the food courts are
you take bus number one-three-one and you will reach there about fifteen or ten minutes
you take bus number one-three-one and you will reach there about fifteen or ten minutes
uh the bus fare would be under a dollar for the two stops
uh the bus fare would be under a dollar for the two stops
so you don't have to worry about topping up the value
so short stops is under a dollar
uh longer stops may be up to a little over two dollars
if you travel by train it's a bit more expensive
uh do you want to visit the zoo and the night safari
okay i think you put in uh maybe- put aside another twenty dollars to top it up
it's twelve dollars to buy the card
okay
but that's more than enough
you uh-
it's just so you don't have to worry about
you know um- uh topping it up
uh if you go to a seven eleven store which is open round the clock you would be able to top-up your card
but if you put more you save time
yah
yes that's ri~
uh then you can go the-
okay
i'll give you the website of wildlife reserves
and i suggest you buy a package ticket so it is uh cheaper for you for the entrance fees
and i suggest you buy a package ticket so it is uh cheaper for you for the entrance fees
but you can either choose to visit two parks or three parks
but whatever you choose if you buy separately say you entered the zoo and then next day you enter the bird park and you're buying individual tickets you are paying more
so if you decide where you want to go and then you uh buy the ticket on your first visit then you hold on to the ticket and on the next- at the next park you just present the same ticket
uh wildlife reserves i am not sure
but if you want to pay for your hotel in advance i'm very sure they're very happy to take your money
you can give them your credit card number and they will send you an e-mail confirmation
so you- at least for the hotel booking uh which i think is very wise of you to book in advance
yes
unless you buy from a travel age~ and then-
you buying a whole-
yes
yes i'm here
so see
we have a successful hornbill nesting uh in the park
and in fact we are releasing some of the hornbills into singapore
oh
here you see the uh-
aviary
uh here you can volunteer to take part in the show without paying extra
uh i shouldn't tell you i take away the fun
ah okay
king of the skies they ask you to participate
and uh you just put up your hand and if they select you then you go up there
uh so you may or may not be selected
uh not you i think
uh sometimes they don't take very young children
so the uh trainers know what to do
so the uh trainers know what to do
you can also uh when you arrive get the uh feeding time schedule
and if you plan your visit to particular aviaries during feeding times you can watch them being fed
so in the african uh aviary that you saw a minute ago you can hold the bird seeds- actually they are worms
you hold them in your hand and the birds will come and take the worms off your hands
oh no uh i think not in singapore
let me try and get you uh okay the zoo
yes and it's an open zoo uh next to a reservoir
yes and it's an open zoo uh next to a reservoir
so it's very scenic
so it's very scenic
i think uh you would love it for its photography
uh the only new things you see is this
it's- it's a naked mole rat
so it doesn't have any hair
bu~ i know you're expecting something else
okay
uh look
can you see the great rift valley of ethiopia
can you see that on your screen
hello!
we got them from ethiopia and we have set-up an environment like they would live-in africa
oh no uh the only baboons are the human ones
uh these baboons-
the- uh these baboons are- they have been replica~ there have been very successful breeding there so- so it's a very large population
and you are likely to see maybe a mother feeding a young
uh it's- the enclosure is glass
yes
oh yah
it can be scary
we have monkeys not baboons
uh monkeys that uh that in the you know in the forest areas
so we tell people not to feed them because we feed them then they expect food
uh you can eat with the orang-utans though
can you see the middle one
the jungle breakfast with wildlife
uh you actually eat your own breakfast
but during breakfast time they come down and they have a buffet of fruits to eat
and then after that you would be invited to take photographs with them
no they don't like our kind of junk food
they have better food
they have fruits
they are more health conscious
okay
okay the last one is the uh river saf~ uh sorry
the night safari
there's also a river safari you can take inside the zoo which is new
but you might- be running out of time
so let me show you the night safari
just had a baby giraffe born
so it' very interesting to see
i can't promise that
um the- you will have to see the situation uh when you get there because they take care of the young uh- likely you can see because it will be with the mother if they do not put it aside uh some place
uh you take a tram that looks a tiger at the back
okay
and they quite tame so they roam around uh the path of the trams
they try and give way but sometimes they forget the traffic rules
but you know they won't listen to you if you tell them to get out of the way
so if you're on the tram ride and they are there uh it's nicer
because when you wait then you have a chance to see better
uh you can get in earlier to have your dinner
and walk across their carpark to the night safari
because that's when we get night time
uh the keepers will put food near to where the lights are
and that would be in an area where- as you are on the tram you can get a very good view of them
so you will be able to see them
so you cannot use your camera
uh firstly it disturbs the animals and then second you also disturb the other people on the tram ride
so they don't allow photography uh-
you can bring your camera because in the outside area where there are no animals many people take photographs
no you can't because you spook the animals
and- uh you can see this show the creatures of the night show
so uh again i'm not gonna tell you
you have to visit the zoo
uh actually i forget
i forget what it is
uh but you know when you go there if you don't want- you're not comfortable with the animals right above your head you just avoid the- overhanging uh rope and you just go little bit further back and you can see it as it goes along
okay wait
first
okay
okay
there you seeing some of the animals
this is in the night safari
these are beautiful they are anteaters
and antelopes
yes i'm trying to get the prices for you
wait just a minute
yah
okay sorry
here it is
uh so if you're visiting all three you pay only fifty-eight dollars per person
you see up here
if you're visiting only the night safari it's thirty-two dollars
yes that's right
so-
yes
a hundred sixteen actually right
it's fifty-eight per person
yes that's right hm
yah
e~ uh if you're at the zoo you can eat at the zoo
there are places to eat
uh or you can walk over to the night safari and you can either have a regular chinese meal or a buffet or you can have sandwiches uh burgers
but there's no bongo meat in it
you just get a chicken or i think may be uh fish
i'm not sure if it's available
so don't worry about eating wild animals there
hm it is- okay you're most welcome
thank you
nice talking to you
bye
bye
this is tour guide- my name is lynnette and who am i speaking to
okay
okay
hi aaki
and how may i- okay i'm fine
and how may i help you today
sure
if you are talking about this uh year uh we have a period of time that coming up really soon end of may and december because- then we have this great singapore sale
so almost all the shops in singapore are having good discounts uh for their shopping
so that maybe one time that you'd like to consider
the other period of time where we do have big celebration in singapore would be uh hari raya uh puasa
uh and you will find a lot of food that specially prepared to welcome hari raya puasa um being uh on sale at these two location
so that is one other uh month that you want to consider coming to singapore
the other month would be in november and that's where the indians get to celebrate deepavali and we light up serangoon road
so uh these ro- few roads that i mentioned uh will gives you very good uh photo opportunities because the streets are beautifully decorated uh to remember or to celebrate these special days
and of course in december we light up the whole street of orchard road right up to the marina area and again with a christmas theme
so different months for you to choose
so again depending on uh what would you like and whether it fits into your schedule
so um most of these months is perfectly fine to come to singapore
but if you can't fit in your schedule in those months then you can always uh do it any other time uh that you like
okay yah
okay
hari raya is a festival that celebrated by the malays here
um now in- uh before hari raya the muslims would do um a puasa that means they do not eat from uh- yes from uh early morning uh from dawn to dusk alright
so uh after the uh evening period that's they can eat until day break again
so-
yes
uh malay
so these are festivals celebrated by the malay people
so in order to celebrate this festival they will dress up their houses clean up their houses
not that they don't clean the houses but they do very thorough cleaning of their houses as well as- uh prepare their house for a visits by their relatives and friends
so they would buy a food like for example special cookies that they may not eat for the rest of the year but specially made for the hari raya so that their friends uh and relatives when they visit them can get to taste all the um yummy cookies and food
yes
the uh muslims will only do fasting before hari raya puasa alright
now once the- they have uh completed their one month fasting uh they will celebrate hari raya
and i'm not saying that they don't eat during the fasting season i'm just saying that from day break to dusk they do not eat or drink
but after they break their fast everyday uh in the evening usually at about seven plus in the evening
uh five plus seven plus depending on the uh moon uh they will be able to eat
and once day break they will uh start to fast their fast again
uh august
yes
yes the hari raya puasa is a public holiday in singapore
uh no for the guides will be business as usual
okay
in november the uh indians another race in singapore will be celebrating a major festival called deepavali and this is a festival of light
alright they don't have like uh a fixed time for fasting
so uh they will start to prepare for this big celebration uh by yearly thoroughly cleaning their houses uh making new curtains making new cushions buying new clothes for everyone to wear and of course again food plays a very important part in all our festivals
so again preparing food uh sweets uh for their guests to enjoy when their guests friends and relatives visit them during uh the deepavali season
well uh the traditional clothes for the indians- because the indians come from the southern part of singapore
uh yes so the southern indians would be wearing um uh sari
uh it can come in any kind of materials from cotton right up to silk and the ladies would wear them with a short blouse
so that would be the traditional costume for the south indian ladies
but uh a lot of the ladies here they do wear- the north indian ladies they wear this uh salwar kameez which is uh consist of a long blouse and long pants uh with a scarf
so- yes that is also a traditional kind of a costume
uh but- yes it is still uh a normal every day kind of a dressing for our malay la~ uh for our indian ladies here
okay
for the sari it's actually a piece of material that is five point five metre long alright
uh no it's for the ladies
sorry
no you are talking about sari right
okay sari is uh worn uh by the ladies
the guys-
okay
the guys will be wearing um quite similar to what the uh malay guys are wearing
okay
sure no problem
yes
yes
oh yes uh- okay now- yes the image for the sari this is quite a modern uh- yah version of the sari
you can see now on the screen
okay let me just go-
okay
yes
you can see all these beautiful ladies wearing the traditional sari alright
very colourful
yah very colourful sari
it's a piece of uh cloth like i mentioned uh there is no ti- uh and there's no zip or buttons on the sari the bottom part the skirt
yah and the ladies-
yah
and the ladies wear them with a short uh blouse
yes so you see um this-
yes so you see um this-
uh well i wouldn't say they use these clothes but if you're talking about the- wearing a traditional costume yes
uh quite a lot of our indian ladies today they would still try to wear traditional clothings especially when it comes to um uh major festivals uh like uh for example uh the deepavali
yes they do try and wear uh this kind of uh costume
yes they do try and wear uh this kind of uh costume
yes
well uh deepavali is actually called the festival of light it's because uh the indians in their home they would like to light this um incense and uh a candle uh in this incense- uh candle holder in their home
uh so this is all this festival is all about
uh up to the individual whether they want to use a scented or just a normal uh kind of uh candle
yes
alright
uh it's quite a simple clothing
okay
after-
uh no uh special uh well we can call it-
yah
kurta
kurta k u r t a
yah
kurta
kurta um-
yah
kurta yah
yah
uh for the indians in singapore uh well i would say that majority of them would be uh third generation singaporeans already
so uh even i think in their own home they would be speaking english but uh a lot of the ancestors- the indian ancestors would come from uh southern part of india uh so yes they would be speaking tamil
yes the mother tongue for the indians uh in singapore generally uh tamil uh unless they come from the northern part of singapore then they would be speaking hindi
but incident-
yes
but inci~
incidentally uh tamil is one of our official languages out here in singapore
uh we don't say dress uh kurta is fine
yah
okay
yah
the indians would visit uh their relatives and friends and of course they get to uh eat
like i said the families would be busy cooking uh uh to make sure when their friends and relatives come and visit they would have food available for them
so um they will be cooking things like curry different kind of uh flavour of curry
uh eating this curry with rice or with um uh bread like uh chapatti that's made from wheat flour or roti prata
uh may~ but it maybe a little bit difficult to make this at home uh or naan alright
naan is uh of course the indian bread
yah
so these are uh some of the foods that the indians uh would be preparing
so they can make from coconut uh they can make from beans yellow beans lentil
uh they can make them from uh vegetables as well as spinach
so these are some of the dishes and food that the indians would prepare to welcome their friends and relative
as to partying yah i think some of the younger people yes they may go out partying in the various clubs that we have in singapore
uh so- but i think for deepavali the majority of the time they would like to spent time with their family uh and visiting one another
uh okay
i uh mentioned that actually all the time they would be eating uh a lot of this bread like roti prata chapatti naan with curry
okay i'm gonna show you some uh uh show you a picture of this tandoori
it is a chicken that is cooked with a spice alright
and a red colour uh colouring
so that is the tandoori
uh it can be a plain rice
uh i'm talking about the chicken huh
so th~
so this is uh usually it's quite red in colour the tandoori uh chicken
yah
they put this chicken um and cook them in uh this big uh kind of a clay pot uh
so that is-
yah
yes
uh okay hold on
i'll get another recipe out here
yah
yes
but if- they do- um yah but- you see- uh if they do not have time they can always buy them uh from the hote~ uh from the restaurants or buy them from cafes
uh so these are just very i would say typical uh indian dishes that indians would prepare either at home or they buy them uh from the uh restaurant
now and the indians- yes they do eat uh a lot of this food
they eat uh basmati rice which is the longer kind of rice grain
they eat uh basmati rice which is the longer kind of rice grain
so they would be uh eating this rather from- uh rather than rice that comes from thailand alright which is the shorter rice grain
so this is the kind of uh- just some examples of uh indian food that we have okay
and then of course um a lot of families do prepare masalas
uh like i said those are sauces and they come in like white colour green colour orange colour because they are made from different kind of ingredients
the yellow colour masalas would be made from beans
yes
uh this will be the celebration for christmas
well in singapore whatever races or uh belief uh that we come from uh everybody else i think celebrate christmas here in singapore because the streets in orchard road uh will be lighted up very beautifully
so i'm just going to show you uh last year uh the light up on orchard road
okay
well you can walk
uh no not from the airport alright
uh what i meant by walking is well you can stay anywhere in singapore
so you just go the orchard road and-
i wouldn't say the uh main city
so that's why i say you walk and you um enjoy the lights and lots of bus- uh photo opportunities
alright beautiful lightings because every year the lights are uh different
the decorations on the buildings on orchard road because every other building on orchard road is either a hotel or a shopping complex
uh that- then that is participation
yes it's very pretty in the month of december
yes it's very pretty in the month of december
uh yes we do have
uh on the christmas day uh christmas eve we- what we do is you see now a lot of cars on the street
what we do is we close this street
yes i'm-
inside just-
eight pm
eight pm
eight pm until uh twelve midnight
eight pm until uh twelve midnight
uh in fact we just close this street uh just over the last weekend
we had the fashion uh step out uh fashion
the models are modelling on the street
okay so- well something- this is the first time that we are doing it fashion step out
okay yah
uh no orchard road is one uh long street of shopping uh opportunities
so- okay
orchard road itself is about uh three kilometres long
so every other building would be a shopping mall or hotel
in fact- okay
we don't have uh three star hotel in orchard road we do have four star
uh just about ten minutes' walk we have this hotel called elizabeth hotel
yah
it's a small hotel
okay let me just show you
yah
this is-
the rates wise for this hotel is approximately about two hundred and fifty dollars this is one option
so you can stay in this hotel
uh the other hotel just next door to this hotel is this hotel called york hotel
because uh i'm just uh choosing some hotels just very close to orchard road since you know i think you may decide to come in the month of uh december
the charges approximately uh two hundred and eighty dollars per room per night
so this is another option
uh otherwise you could stay in this hotel called grand park hotel city hall
you could also choose to stay here as well
differences as in location
okay
uh all the three hotels they have full amenities so they have breakfast available in the morning
uh they have uh um cafes in the hotel
so if you don't want to eat out you can always eat inside the hotel
you could have room service as well in these three hotels
now if you want a little bit more affordable you can stay in this hotel called um grand central
that is also just a five minutes' walk uh from the uh orchard belt area
uh grand cen~
uh no uh for all our hotels we don't have uh shows in the hotel itself because they don't have uh like concert theatre
uh no uh for all our hotels we don't have uh shows in the hotel itself because they don't have uh like concert theatre

yes
yah
about uh-
because uh we have to take into account how much you want to spent in singapore right
because uh we have to take into account how much you want to spent in singapore right

two stations away uh or one and a half stations away from uh the marina bay
and you will be walking- uh there is actually um air-conditioned underpass all the way the way from the marina bay sands right up to raffles place and from raffles place mrt one station to city hall
okay
if you see the place-
okay
so i think i've- have i given you a lot of things to do in singapore for your short stay
yah just to party right

okay not romeo and juliet huh
okay don jum- uh romeo how can i help you today
uh for any celebrations
oh okay
well i would give you uh maybe a very romantic place uh for proposal
okay i'd like to introduce you to this place called jewel box
yah
well it's actually a dining in uh right on top of mt faber
you can see this is- yah
right okay
we only have hills
okay
yes uh- well this is not really a beach
yes uh- well this is not really a beach
i'm just going to show you these images of this park
it's called uh labrador park
okay this is still very romantic as well
okay this is still very romantic as well
okay this is still very romantic as well
okay
you know you can see this is actually a - and bridegroom taking photographs on the labrador park
it's pretty quiet in the night time
yah so this is the labrador park out here
of course there' s a little bit of history
you can see that- and again the wedding couple taking photographs
yah so this is quite a romantic spot uh for a proposal
yes and this is the view of the night time sunset
okay so this is-
okay this is just one of the places that you can consider uh for a proposal
okay this is just one of the places that you can consider uh for a proposal
okay and it's not that crowded
okay and it's not that crowded
alright in the evening there would be some people around but uh like i said it's not that crowded
alright it's just uh there will be just a bit- a few people out there
yah but anyway it's a safe place
yah but anyway it's a safe place
and with them a few people around
um ya i think that's nice as well
okay
so this is uh one of the location that you may want to consider
um otherwise we have lots of other parks
uh somewhere this one nearer to the uh botanical gardens
sure uh- okay
then i will propose- okay maybe you have to look at this botanical garden
so you can see there's so many beautiful spots where you can do your proposal
so you can see there's so many beautiful spots where you can do your proposal
again because it's big enough for you to choose your uh favourite uh place where she likes
again because it's big enough for you to choose your uh favourite uh place where she likes
and you can now do the proposal out there
okay the more closest to the botanical gardens would be the tanglin mall
um yes
okay this is the tanglin mall
it's just at the end of the orchard belt area
and the botanical garden is just diagonally across
so you can take her to this mall first
but this is not uh- this mall is not as big as the other malls in singapore
so you just want to do with just uh a quick spot of uh shopping before you go to the gardens
alright
okay so you could have a meal out there as well there are restaurants option uh in the tanglin mall
okay so you could have a meal out there as well there are restaurants option uh in the tanglin mall
and like i've said you just walked across- diagonally across
and you will be at the uh main gate of the botanical gardens
so you can just walk and uh have a nice stroll in the garden
and the garden closes its door at twelve midnight
yah so you are uh going to do your proposal in the botanical gardens
now from here you are actually down in orchard road
uh so again if you just walk uh just the- from the tanglin mall you just walk down
uh you will come to orchard road
uh and over that way that is actually a shopping or- um hotel right next to one another
this photo was taken during the christmas season
yah
uh you can make it here the next- the coming christmas in december
uh well it depends on where you want to stay
uh around this area because this is actually at the other end of the orchard road
so it- there are few hotels here
um we have the traders hotel
it's just next door to this mall
the tanglin- yah i mean if you are talking about you don't want to walk too far
there's a traders hotel
okay i think this is quite a good choice uh hotel
um but like i said any other hotel along orchard road
since this is going to be your proposal trip
then i will propose that uh stay in a nicer hotel
so any other hotel on the street itself uh would be a relatively uh good hotel
um we have right smacked in the heart of uh the orchard hotel
we have uh a relative new hotel by the name of uh grand park orchard
yes
let me just- okay
this is orchard grand park
this is orchard grand park hotel
okay this is one straight road
um the earlier hotels i proposed to you is on this side
on the left-hand side
and grand park will be right smacked in orchard road
uh yup
it's about uh just a leisurely walk about twenty minutes and you'll be in the park
bus
alright
and uh you will be alighting at the fourth bus stop
uh bus number seventy-five
um yes
yes i mean i think they are uh suitable uh for a couple- uh to have a nice time in singapore
the spa you know uh in singapore
so we do have spa treatment
okay so- okay these are just some of the option uh that we have and- well there are nice places with very uh relaxing spa in singapore
for example you can uh do the one at raffles city
uh okay
uh this is in sentosa
yah
it's uh one of our offshore uh resort island
but anyway there are also nice spa on the mainland itself
pamper her with uh a spa treatment
okay
so not that she has to decide whether to marry you or not eh okay so- yah nearby to grand park-
uh they have all these uh spa treatment
uh yes
alright
uh why don't you do- why don't you give her the spa treatment in the afternoon
then you could go to the garden
so your proposal in the night time
and either you give her a nice dinner treat first uh before the proposal
yah
so what you can do is we have this uh very interesting- or i would say uh dinner place in the botanical garden
uh which are then at the botanical gardens
uh which are then at the botanical gardens
i'm gonna show you some images
and later just go for a stroll in the garden
yah
alright
you can see
it will be- yah
it will be western food in this uh restaurant in a colonial house
yah
this is that your- this uh restaurant is built in the garden
alright
so both of you will be in a relaxed mood
um enjoy a dinner in the garden
and then go for a stroll
okay
okay
sure
you just go um next door to the shopping mall
okay
then you have to uh travel a little bit
alright
um you go this placed called dempsey
okay
now this is just about- it will be a little bit inconvenient- uh because there is no mrt ride that's so close to the little hill up here
alright from uh orchard road
okay
from the traders hotel you will walk about twenty-five minutes
yah
if you want walk
um so there are quite a few dinner options out here
uh ranging from indian food to chinese food
uh chili crab in our chinese restaurant
um indian food uh like curries
a lot of curries
so good- well one of our very popular food in uh singapore would be chili crab pepper crab
uh but it's not- you don't really want to eat with your hands
it's alright
it's perfectly fine when you eat crabs using your hands
it's perfectly fine when you eat crabs using your hands
it's acceptable uh etiquette uh out here in singapore
now um- so this is- we're quite famous now
uh lot of people come here
and it's one of the must do in singapore uh having this uh crab
it's a bit spicy though i must warn you first
okay
if you want something a little bit uh not so exotic
we are also very famous uh for chicken rice
yah
okay
yes
the chicken rice is the rice is cooked with the chicken stock
uh so it's very tasty and- well it's also one of our favourite food out here
chicken rice
okay
and uh-
okay
it's marinated meat
you can have chicken uh mutton
lamb
then you'd be able to get pork satay
but if you buy them from the uh malay store owner they won't sell pork satay
uh so this is marinated meat pierced through a skewer the garnishes
and you can order a side dish of the rice uh ketupat
this is rice uh cooked in uh leaf
a packet uh- leaf packet alright
and this is actually almost a complete meal already
you have your meat you have your vegetables and you have rice
it looks yummy right
okay
so you can have that - oh if you want to have your dinner in another place
you can choose to go to one fullerton
okay
there's where you can have your chili crabs here as well
alright
they serve chili crab at one fullerton uh
okay
and it's romantic as well
um so that's very uh romantic as well in the night time
it's about twenty-five minutes
and it's a little bit up slope and down slope
so maybe this would be a better choice
uh just a very slow walk uh through a three miles of uh esplanade area
and you can even do your proposal at the esplanade
yah
so you can walk back you know
remember just now you saw the bay
okay
so you just walk back a little bit uh on the three uh line and you're still walking on the bay
so it's a nice uh evening stroll out here
and again uh they are not so crowded
you can always find a spot again to do your proposal if you want to do it
by the bay or go back to the botanical gardens and do your proposal out there
uh yah
yah because this is very iconic
yah it looks like porcupine right
yah it looks like porcupine right
there are two of them
uh well the local like to call this the durian
which you have this fruit back home as well
which you have this fruit back home as well
this is- one of them is a theatre and the other one is um a concert hall
so yes only singapore have these uh two uh buildings out here
so you can just do your proposal anywhere along the marina bay
and in the night time it looks really nice
see how lighted up it is
okay
yah
i know there's a lightning
yes it's actually a nice spot as well
but at least you can always have the crab at the one fullerton
and you just take a very short uh walk along the marina bay uh along the esplanade area
and you come to the esplanade
so a really slow takes you about uh fifteen minutes
very slow
yah
yah it sounds good
but we don't call it porcupine
yah
um yes so maybe the uh morning uh botanical gardens
um yes so maybe the uh morning uh botanical gardens
uh i think you should do it in the morning when it's not so hot
uh i think you should do it in the morning when it's not so hot
yah so- because the park opens as early as five
so- but if you are getting up uh a bit later is still fine
but uh maybe by eleven o'clock you should leave the botanical gardens
because it's starting to get a little bit warm in the afternoon
uh hm okay
we have the dry day today
uh temperature-wise it's uh- well throughout the whole year it doesn't change very much
um approximately in the mid-afternoon about thirty-two degrees- thirty to thirty-three- two degrees
and slowly rising up to thirty degrees
well if she accepts your proposal then of course you can do a bit of sightseeing in singapore
right
so you could do a little bit of the uh what do you called that
the photo spot to have uh some good memories of singapore
so again if you just go back- uh okay i would say that you would probably have some photograph taken in the night time of the bay
as well as the merlion
alright the merlion that is facing the bay
okay
let's scroll down again
and see whether we get the merlion
yes
and can see the merlion out here
okay so you- so you would probably be getting some spot
so the next day you don't have to come back to the marina bay
so what you do is um you can go to our ethnic areas
so what you do is um you can go to our ethnic areas
uh like-
okay
you can go to a place called uh kampong glam
okay
just give me moment
yes
so that-
well you can go to this place
the food as well
okay
and this you can try again some uh malay cuisine indian cuisine arabic egyptian cuisine turkish cuisine
they can be found in this area called kampong glam
alright
it's quite a big street
because the shops are owned by pretty young entrepreneurs
so you don't find them in uh our shopping mall
so they basically have just one shop
your girlfriend not really into shopping
it's also a very nice uh way to just soak in a little bit of the atmosphere out here
uh and just have the feel of these quaint uh shops
and you can see this particular street is quite narrow
so this is haji lane over in kampong glam
alright you could always stop-
alright you could always stop- kampong glam
k a m p o n g next word glam g l a m so you could do a spot of like window shopping
uh to be done to the walls uh in kampong glam
okay
yes i'm sure she should be able to pick up something uh from this lane
um you could also enjoy a sport of um shisha
yes
um-
okay
this is- okay
this is kampong glam here
let see whether we get any picture of these water pipes
it's um-
the mrt uh- the stop that you're going to alight would be at the bugis mrt
yah we have uh -
okay uh yah i can't find any uh images of the uh water pipes
oh you could also do-
yes
flavoured water
but uh instead of uh the normal way of smoking
it's filled with flavoured water
yes
it's actually smoking flavoured water
over here
uh no okay but now i'm showing you some photograph of what people- um this is called shisha
in the past yes kampong glam was right next to the water
but not today
okay
so this is the uh water pipes and that's uh available uh at the kampong glam area
okay
so a picture uh says a thousand words yah
so this is the- what uh shisha is all about
okay
so it's something different alright from what you would uh be able to see or do um back home
so this is one of them
um like curry puff
okay
okay alright
you can spend about uh one hour just to walk around
um and also- okay but the muslims they do not uh buy uh the normal perfumes from the normal uh kind of the perfume shops
so what they do is they buy perfumes
so what they do is they buy perfumes
uh and they do not contain alcohol
so- yes
okay this is uh perfume shops in kampong glam
okay this is uh perfume shops in kampong glam
so you are asking me about some sightseeing
so this is-
you see all the colourful bottles that you can get from kampong glam
and you can fill them up with perfume
uh beautiful fabrics in case she wants to uh tailor some clothes from these beautiful fabrics
alright
so this is uh some sightseeing along with a little bit of shopping
and there's the houses in kampong glam very historical
more than one hundred years old
traditionally there was- this was where a lot of the arabs used to live
okay
example you can take the mrt again from bugis
change station at dhoby ghaut mrt train station
and proceed on to little india
lindia- india
again very colourful as well
colourful flowers garlands
alright
so you have a little bit of cultural aspect
a bit of sightseeing
uh the architecture and notice there are two-storey not three-storey
so a little bit of that
uh i would suggest that for ethnic area
it is better to do them in the day time
because there are more activities going on
and of course if you just walk around the esplanade area
it's our supreme court
okay
yah so you can do a sport of uh sightseeing around the bay area
so you get to see the historical area
for example this green dome building
now it's undergoing restoration
this used to be our old supreme court
and this building now that looks like- i like to call it the spaceship building
okay
uh this one that have this- yes
yah you called it a plate
okay
so this is the new supreme court
um and around the- this greenfield you have of course uh the colonial buildings of singapore
so that's a little bit of uh sightseeing out here
and again you'll be looking at- you will also-
okay
you are- you will also be passing by some of these other historical areas
like uh the parliament house
okay
yes
uh visit as in passing by or going into the building
this one
okay
this one is parliament house
uh if you want to visit we- i would suggest by the side of the parliament house
we have a gallery
yah
uh if there is no parliament sitting uh- no then there will be no entry uh into the parliament house
so there's a little bit of uh restriction going into the parliament house
otherwise the one that i showed you just now the uh supreme court
yes you are allowed to enter into the supreme court subject to the security checks
yes you are allowed to enter into the supreme court subject to the security checks
uh that we will require anyone who needs to enter into the supreme court
yap
yes i agree
but- yes
yah
so you can do a ride on this boat
we called it the singapore uh cruises
and this boat plies on the singapore river
it is a half an hour ride
uh that would cost you fifteen dollars for an adult
uh it's very relaxing
you know you can do your walk around the next day- second day alright
do a walk and then- but if you're a little bit tired you can just go on to this boat ride
so you could do this uh boat ride on the singapore river
because the river is very historical
um and that's how singapore get rich in the early days
because this was our port
so uh- yes on the boat you will get to have an idea how people used to live along the river
but the boats are slightly smaller in the past
in the past they will run on diesel
okay
so that is a relaxing ride on the singapore river
okay
it doesn't make a difference
where you see all the historical buildings
where you see all the historical buildings
now take a two hours walk at- or three hours walk you know if some of the buildings you may want to go inside
and in the af~ uh have uh a break for lunch in the surrounding area
there are some small bistro out there
uh or you can go to high street again
it's just about a five minutes' walk uh from the parliament house
uh there is a food court there
that served all the street food and aboard uh river cruise um-
that served all the street food and aboard uh river cruise um- uh on the singapore river
alright
and the boat will again bring you all the way out to the marina bay
and you get to see the merlion uh from a different angle
alright
the first night you are on the edge of the marina- uh of the merlion
now if you take this boat you are looking at the merlion from the waters
okay
it's fine
uh then you could have a spot of um lunch- alright a leisurely lunch
and take a rest in the uh hotel before you do another night spot again
okay
so after your boat cruise uh what you could do is you bring her back to the- again if you don't want to go too far away from where you are
so after your boat cruise uh what you could do is you bring her back to the- again if you don't want to go too far away from where you are
you could just do a very small area
then you go to the shopping centre called uh raffles city
alright
so raffles city uh they are like five- four lev~ uh five level two basement area
uh where she can do her shopping
branded stuff mid-range
and if that is not enough still she can go to the underground
and do uh some serious shopping again
the underground city mall- uh citylink will be just mid-range products
and if again that's not enough by the time she goes through the underground city ma~ uh okay this is a picture of the raffles city
by the time she walked over to another shopping mall called marina square
so yes she can really shop 'til she drop
don't worry
our shops here we accept plastic cards
okay
so she can do uh spot of uh serious shopping again in the marina um uh square
alright
okay
so you must remember to buy her a big diamond ring then
okay
and again if you don't want to get too far away- but if you want to see a little bit more then of course you can always go back to the orchard road
um uh for her shopping uh requirements
yes
oh for food is it
sweet and romantic and yet local
okay
uh sweet okay
i mean like main courses generally they will not be sweet
um but something that is very unique and i don't think you get that in um uh philippines
uh remember the satay that i showed you
okay
so uh you could do that
uh do you still need me to show you the photographs of satay
so you can have that
uh otherwise one of our uh very popular dish uh would be this uh fried noodles- hokkien fried noodle
yah
so this is the uh something which is quite unique uh in singapore
it's cooked with a little bit of seafood
alright
yes
and some of the store do serve them with a piece of banana uh leaf at the bottom
and then you can see there's a lime for you to make the dish a little bit sour
of course the chili will be a little hot
um yah something a little bit unique out here uh in singapore
hokkien mee
yah
otherwise if you still would like to do a little bit of sightseeing
then maybe i could recommend that you go to the night safari
yah
okay
yes
uh all the restaurant
chinese restaurant would be able to serve you these dishes
it's quite a common uh food uh that a lot of the locals like to eat
um then you can all- um you could have like uh early dinner
and then proceed on to the northern part of singapore
uh by taking the train and the bus and you will arrive in the night safari park
because the park only opens in the night time
the park opens at seven-thirty in the evening
the park opens at seven-thirty in the evening
and it closes its door at twelve midnight
well it is enough
if you have two and a half hours to spend inside the park
uh yes
it's quite a big park
um and what you will do is you would go on the tram ride
um and what you will do is you would go on the tram ride
if you see this uh picture over here on the left-hand side
now this is a tram ride
so you get onto this tram
the whole ride without stopping will take you about forty minutes
but if you make a stop midway and you walked uh the leopard's trail
uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail
and when you finished the trail you come back to the tram station
and you board the next tram back to the entrance
and if you still are energetic enough you can still do another walking trail
alright
yah
it is not then- it's good enough if you just do the tram ride
uh you already see seventy per cent of the animal
and i think that would be sort of a wrap up in your second uh day in singapore
without getting off the tram you would take forty minutes
yes
based on your requirements
a little bit of sightseeing
a little bit of relaxation
and not just hopping from place to another
and i think this would be- well uh what i would recommend for you to do in singapore
well okay after the uh- if you two decide to exit from the park at the main entrance area we have what we called the foot reflexology
okay
and uh you will soak your feet in this pool
uh and these fishes will come and nibble at your feet
have you had this experience before
yes
so you could do that
uh and they have uh a spot of this uh fish at foot areas- fish spa
uh just outside the um- the night safari park
yes
that you can see the picture now
the- these are doctor fish
so they come and nibble at your fish
and the sensation will be a little of this uh tingling- ticklish
yah ticklish effect
and then- yah yes you will feel pretty relaxed after this um uh spot of uh at uh fifteen minutes
it's good enough
yah uh relax
so we end up the day with that
maybe
yah that's why the fishes are going i think to her feet
right
okay
and you get the nice- at the same time your feet feel relaxed you know after a day of walking
and your dead skins are removed
yes
so i think it's a nice day to end the day

just give us a-
just a give us a while for it to come on screen
uh what were you going to ask me
uh the rooms are small in chinatown and in little india because they occupy what used to be shophouses
and uh hotels what they do is they uh- the owners buy up several uh units of these of shophouses and convert them into hotels
but let me show you a picture uh of the hotel
this uh up
let me have a look
okay
well you don't need to worry about the dining area
this is the reception area
because in chinatown after you put down your bags you just walk out and there are lots of places to eat
okay let me see
it has got- can you see the amenities
internet access air conditioning internet services lounges and bars
not in the hotel but in the vicinity plenty of places to eat
uh why the restaurants don't- uh why the hotels they don't provide food is because i think the guest prefer to just go out and try uh either street food or food from the cafés and restaurants nearby
uh why the restaurants don't- uh why the hotels they don't provide food is because i think the guest prefer to just go out and try uh either street food or food from the cafés and restaurants nearby
yah

for free and they are very informative
for free and they are very informative
this is a traditional set of uh tables that we used to have in our kitchen
so you can have breakfast in your kitchen marble table and two chairs
so uh this is the dining area
actually i think you can get- can you see this at the corner on the left-hand side
you should be able to get snacks like curry puffs cakes
uh coffee and tea
as you go upstairs this is your room then
uh i don't think so because these are just three-story buildings
they're very small
uh they are very cosy because they are in restored buildings that are protected
are you thinking of uh more modern type of hotel
are you thinking of uh more modern type of hotel
so- so you want a two to three-star hotel-
okay
shall we try this furama uh riverfront hotel
it's by the river and uh it's a more modern style hotel with larger rooms
yes uh- it's your preference you know what i mean
this is-
yah
so the reception areas are larger- let me go through the- uh it's going through automatically
that's the reception area
if you have a good appetite
uh i have to check that out
let me see if it's inclusive of breakfast
sorry
it doesn't state it
yes you go that website
uh it's by the river and it's not so near to chinatown then
you have to travel by bus into chinatown
but this is definitely a bigger hotel i think more to your taste
so it would be wi~ no it's not far
it's about two three bus stops away
the chinatown area has another hotel in chinatown but it's not as pretty as this one from the outside
the chinatown area has another hotel in chinatown but it's not as pretty as this one from the outside
it's an older version of a hotel
it's an older version of a hotel
you have to walk to clarke quay from here
but it's within walking distance
yes walking distance to clarke quay
there is another hotel by the river if you want to be on the riverfront is called the gallery hotel
but let's have a look at this one
there's another furama- you want to be in the middle of chinatown
this is also in the city
this is also in the city
is just uh not as convenient as the previous hotel that i showed you
is just uh not as convenient as the previous hotel that i showed you
because the chinatown stop on the subways stops exactly there
because the chinatown stop on the subways stops exactly there
uh here it is better if you are tired of walking you can take a bus to connect with the trains to reach your hotel
uh here it is better if you are tired of walking you can take a bus to connect with the trains to reach your hotel
you just stop at the city centre and then you get out and you take one bus number one nine five and it will bring you to your hotel in about fifteen minutes or so
you just stop at the city centre and then you get out and you take one bus number one nine five and it will bring you to your hotel in about fifteen minutes or so
ten minutes actually
ten minutes actually
so if we have red lights along the way then its fifteen minutes
so if we have red lights along the way then its fifteen minutes
the station is city hall
it's a major station and it's in a business district so you don't even need to take that train if you outside your hotel if you take the buses uh you can go to where city hall is and you can walk around the area
we have historic buildings there we have a big theatre and concert hall uh by the bay
oh what you se~ yes i'm here
oh you drop off at city hall station and you take bus number one nine five
that- that's not difficult because it will stop you right in front of your hotel
no we don't have the size
ah yes
yah
so hm oh uh would- yah
so from marina bay if you uh come out and go to the uh city centre area that's where we have the esplanade theatres on the bay
it's uh a big theatre and concert hall
oh i'm not suggesting you watch shows
i'm just suggesting you have a look at the place uh and take photos uh because you are looking out at the marina bay sands hotel which is quite iconic and the uh bay right in front of the singapore river
so that's where many people like to take photographs
and if you want to have a meal you can have it uh inside
uh the shopping where the uh theatres are
can you see the pictures here now
durian yes
that's what it's been called locally
but the architect meant it to look like the top of the microphones
but the architect meant it to look like the top of the microphones
you know the old type of microphone
so you know it as the durian also huh
uh so it's a nice place to take photographs to walk around uh because-
yes you can go inside
yes you can go inside
and uh we sometimes do have lunchtime concerts
uh but that would depend on um the esplanade's uh schedule
it's about only forty five minutes or one hour during lunchtime
it's to encourage locals to step into our concert hall
so that you know later on they would buy the concert tickets and attend that concerts
uh well it depends on what you are interested in
uh well it depends on what you are interested in
uh lots of great shops here and uh chocolate shop
uh lots of great shops here and uh chocolate shop
but if you don't do all that
but if you don't do all that
you just take a look and then you walk along the outside
you just take a look and then you walk along the outside
you can see by the ri~ uh by the theatre you can reach the marina bay
you can see by the ri~ uh by the theatre you can reach the marina bay
so maybe ten fifteen minutes inside and outside to photograph it
and then you walk to merlion
and then you walk to merlion
i think fifteen minutes with you stopping to take photographs
yes you take your photographs you walk slowly and have a look soak in the atmosphere
yes you take your photographs you walk slowly and have a look soak in the atmosphere
yah
yes you can walk and uh i do that as well
because uh you know i don't even think you can take a bus there it's so near
because uh you know i don't even think you can take a bus there it's so near
right
from the merlion park i suggest you get across to uh boat quay and clarke quay
from the merlion park i suggest you get across to uh boat quay and clarke quay
uh see here you are at the bay in front of the river
uh later you uh walk along the singapore river itself
he is a fit
so uh if you did it at seven in the morning it's very nice
i have done it once before
uh you come across some joggers some people walking their dogs
that place- uh depends on what you order actually
uh if you go inside the hotel and you eat at the jade restaurant it would cost you a bit more
maybe uh sixty or seventy dollars a person
maybe uh sixty or seventy dollars a person
if you walk along the singapore river
um there are places that serve lunch at prices that office workers can afford
because many office workers in the area behind can you see the river on the map
so on the south banks of the river where you see north canal road
behind that area is the business district
so you can get a meal there fifteen dollars twenty dollars per person
so you can get a meal there fifteen dollars twenty dollars per person
more than enough for the both of you
uh no i suggest you take a boat
would you like to take a boat home
you know
from the merlion you can board a boat
uh these are electric boats that ply the bay and the river and they also do like a taxi service alo~ with the stops along the river
and there is one stop
at the back of your hotel
oh um if you're taking the taxi ride it's under ten dollars
uh if you do a tour with them going around the bay then it's about fifteen dollars or so
uh just by the river there are restaurant

street shopping i think in chinatown you can do it in the evening
let me tra~
okay if you want to get away from the heat and near to your hotel you can visit a museum just across the road

so that museum is uh- it's by the bay
it's called marina barrage
are you interested in that
are you interested in that
uh it's just the empty water bottles huh
and- uh it will tell you about the bay that you're looking at right in front of you at the merlion
so can you see the pictures there
yes tiny
uh all the rivers
our efforts like cleaning up all our rivers because now some of the rivers flow into this area that is called the marina bay
can you see it at this picture here
yah i'm trying to enlarge it
it's a little bit slow
okay
so it's designed a little bit like uh the number nine
well for- well it's just the architect's design
but uh for a chi~ yah for chinese we do like number nine also
we have to wait a little bit uh for the picture to appear
yes
we have many shopping districts
the one that's most famous is in downtown orchard road
and there you get many high-end brands
as well as uh medium priced
uh another place you might want to check out is opposite to sentosa island and it's called vivocity
it's very popular everyday uh especially in the evenings after work
vivocity and harbourfront
vivocity and harbourfront
uh you can get them there
but you might want to- if you want to save money you go down to chinatown and you would be able to uh buy more things with your money
uh you might want to have dinner um- let me see huh
marina barrage
do you want to have dinner at uh the marina bay sands
uh it's an integrated resort with very high-end uh restaurants
so uh- maybe two three hundred dollars for the both of you
yes
so-
yah that said so
but here you get sort of- can you see fine dining and casual dining
so if you don't pick fine dining it wouldn't be so expensive then
let me think huh
let me find a- a hotel maybe at the- how much- what is your budget
so-
so your budget for this good meal that doesn't cost too much
uh huh
four hundred
double- five- five hundred and thirty five dollars and you don't want to spend it all on dinner
ah okay
two hundred
so you can eat here
so two hundred if you take it out for shopping you still have three hundred over dollars for a fine meal
so two hundred if you take it out for shopping you still have three hundred over dollars for a fine meal
so you can even do fine dining here
yes
okay we got the menu for you here and should have a price there
can you read it
you can't see the price
let me see
fo~ the- yes that is right
so you see if you don't order of full meal from salad soup main meal and then have a dessert and coffee it wouldn't cost you so much
so you see if you don't order of full meal from salad soup main meal and then have a dessert and coffee it wouldn't cost you so much
it's- if you go the all- the full works with wine and everything then it would be more expensive
yes it's uh the chefs are well-known and the ambiance is good
and it's-
uh it's not really floating
it looks floating
it's a three towers uh on the opposite side of the bay
so from where you are looking at it sometimes it looks like it's floating
yes you are right
so that is the hotel and integrated resort
so we have a casino there actually
that's the marina bay sands
but uh-
know it
yes that's right
uh whether it's at the top of the hote~ it may not be right at the top because they have a swimming pool

it may be there i'm not very sure
it may be there i'm not very sure
yes bistro moderne i'm not sure
a few hotels are at the top but i cannot confirm with you whether this one is at the top

would you like to a beach on an island
have you heard of sentosa island
okay let me uh show you-
okay
okay
yes it is easily accessible
and it has got other interesting places besides the beach
the whole island uh has been transformed into an island uh for fun for relaxation not only for tourist but also for singaporeans also
yes we have amusement park there we have uh resorts world singapore with uh universal studios
uh if you are not into rides and you know disneyland kind of uh background uh because i notice you're interested on the be~ about the beach
you can also visit an aquarium on the island where you can see fishes
okay
so-
okay
so here you are looking at uh view of the beach front side of the island which is off the-
yes
sentosa island and you can easily get across by shuttle bus that is provided by the la~
yes
uh let me go to siloso beach because i want to-
uh siloso beach
i don't know how it got its' name but i believe it's filipino for jealousy
yes oh jealous
so here you can see some scenes people playing uh not uh badminton but volleyball
no it's vol~ yah on the beach normally they play volleyball
because if there is a breeze uh yah
uh yes frisbee also
yes on the beach
definitely frisbee
uh and if you enjoy volleyball if they are playing you and your friend can also ask to join them
they would be happy to invite you

yes uh that's when uh group of friends usually on vacation during the school holidays
yes siloso beach
yes siloso beach
and i'm going to uh bring you to underwater world which is just- uh from the beach you just walk to uh underwater world
yes it's all on sentosa island
yes and you notice there's also a fort there
can you see siloso point
so we will do underwater world first
yes yah
there's a dolphin show and you can-
uh dolphin is an add-on to the show
uh the-
uh no it's part of underwater world where you- it's uh yah
yah it's a big aquarium and it's unusual because i believe this was the first time and it started what
uh twenty or more years ago that you also become uh an exhibit for the fish
uh because in the aquarium uh in the sunken section you walk- stand on a travelator around- uh that goes around the aquarium and that means there's gigantic fish tank all around you
yes
yes
uh i haven't been to ocean park but uh if you have the same technology now i think they have the same idea in other parts of the world
but uh when it first opened uh we were told that singapore was the first one
so where you see the uh-
yes the dolphin lagoon is-
uh dolphin lagoon is outside the aquarium it's part of underwater world
and you can see the dolphins performing
just a little short while you know
because dolphins are very friendly but we don't want them to be you know uh too long with humans
they need to be with the dolphins
oh not on sentosa island
surfing you need to have very big waves right
uh singapore our island is uh a port and part of the reason it is attractive to the shipping uh community in the very early days when people use fishing bo~ uh sailing boats is that the waters here are very calm
we are protected by nearby islands
uh rent a swimming pool
you can stay in a hotel with a pool if you like
what sort of amusement are you looking at
animal and wildlife or theme parks
wildlife okay
wildlife okay
i'll get out of this and uh we'll go to one of my favourite places
actually three of my favourite places
so i'll go to their website
yes this is the website
and you'll be able to see some pictures
there are three parks manage by wildlife reserves; the bird park the singapore zoo
both of which you visit in the day
so it is very uh unusual
so you know zoos normally uh when you take photographs sometimes it's doesn't look real
yes you can mingle with them
yes for the wildlife website
the wildlife reserves
have you seen hornbills
here you see the real ones now
there are uh very big aviaries where the hornbills are inside and they have successfully breed in singapore
so we have singapore citizen hornbills
and uh we in fact have been so successful
we have release them into uh mainland singapore
that means they become naturalised already and maybe when you come down the shopping area you might even see a hornbill flying over your head
so- but here you can see the hornbills close-up
different varieties of them
yes so different colours
so i'm trying to show you a little bit more of the uh bird park
so i'm trying to show you a little bit more of the uh bird park
okay attractions
so here you can see free-flight aviary
you go inside the birds are flying all around you
so you're actually inside the aviary
uh feeding
uh the food is put there for you take photographs
but if you get the schedule of the feeding time when you enter then you can time yourself to be at the areas when they are feeding
and if you are tired walking there is a monorail
and if you are tired walking there is a monorail
in fact the only monorail in the world that drives into an aviary
so the monorails stops inside this big huge uh like a bird cage that you are actually inside
all the-
or you can take the ride and then after that you have seen an overview at everything and then you start walking
you have to uh pay a small sum from the keeper uh-
yes just a few dollars
he will give you a little cup of worms
yes
yes
do you like to handle worms
but if you like to try you let the worms sort of tickle your arm and they come down and feed
yes so you know um it's a healthier food for them
yes so you know um it's a healthier food for them
and you see the waterfall at the back of this picture
yes it's very nice place for photography
yes it's very nice place for photography
so two of you going you can stand there and take photographs
so two of you going you can stand there and take photographs
huh
uh you can also walk up the hill of that uh aviary
uh the park is sighted on the side of a hill
so uh there are some areas that many tourist do not go to because you have to climb just a little bit uh-
and you- those areas are very quiet
so if you sit there quietly with your friend he would be able to get very natural photographs of the birds with the trees in the background
because the birds stop and feed
and we also have uh shows
and we also have uh shows
yes bird shows
uh the bird show is a different variety of show
uh the bird show is a different variety of show
let me see if i can get it
yes in that place also
okay
so can you see some pictures here on your right
uh this is in an open area and you get eagles hawks and falcons uh owls also swooping down just a few inches from the top of your head
you must remember that
it's very exciting because uh they are very close to you and you see this girl on the right
it's very exciting because uh they are very close to you and you see this girl on the right
yes that is right
so we don't have a mongolian person there but he's dressed like a mongolian
so we try to give some information in these shows to tell you the background of how the uh hawks were trained
uh if you volunteer like this lady here uh you don't have to be uh lady
yes you uh- this one you know uh she's uh probably a park worker because they used her for the advertisement
uh you can also volunteer and have them land on you because you are adults
no she is a park uh staff
yes i recognise her
she's one of the trainers of the birds
you have to wear a glove
can you see where her hand is
where the birds is
yes it's a very thick leather gloves
yes it's a very thick leather gloves
so you don't worry your- the bird will not you know um hurt your fingers
yes and it was a sport um with the middle eastern people also
yes and it was a sport um with the middle eastern people also
well not if they are singaporeans around there
not many mongolians in singapore
we also have shows for children but i mean this is more exciting show uh that you may want-
yes that's right for adults
so-
yes an owl
uh birds are very difficult to train
be~ yes i have seen the training sessions
so-
uh i'm not sure
i don't think a week is enough
the zoo and the um the zoo and the night safari
uh no you just watch them
and we are- we don't take risk with our tourist
but you can see a nude lady here
i don't know if she's a lady
do you see the picture
this is uh naked mole rat
naked because it has got no hair
yes that is right
yes that is right
uh i'm not a scientist
but i'm sure those teeth have some reason
uh that is like the latest attraction you know
so- yes this is one of the shows you can see
um and you can also participate at the end of the show by feeding
so you just pay a few dollars to the keeper and he will provide you the food
you must understand that this is to make sure the animals are fed with healthy food you know we don't want them to get
yes we have elephants rides as well
yes we have elephants rides as well
yes you can also do that
no it's not so high because the ride in singapore is not a very long journey
no it's not so high because the ride in singapore is not a very long journey
uh i don't know whether you've taken this rides before
uh it's a little bit bumpy
uh so the rides are not extensive
you know what i mean
because go to some other countries they go into the jungle and halfway if you don't like it you have to maybe complete the circuit
yes that is right
in fact i just went there and uh my uh nieces they went on the elephant rides
uh you can also sit on horses
uh we have uh horses
can you see this uh jungle breakfast with wildlife
uh yo~
no that's an orangutan
yes
uh these are- uh now that there are in singapore for a long time uh we feel confident enough to put them in the open but um in a certain areas
so uh lots of trees and trees that have fallen we've use them to create a pathway for the orangutans to climb and to walk
uh you don't really feed them
what you do is you take a photograph with them
what you do is you take a photograph with them
so you see you are eating a normal breakfast here
and the orangutan would uh have his own breakfast
because his basket there is full of fruits
uh smelly food but very delicious like sweet custard
so when it's seasoned he gets to eat it
um the-
i can't quite tell
um sometimes when they come out they bring along their baby
then you know for sure it's a female
so after breakfast the trainer will invite you to go up and take a photograph with the orangutan
so you just have to be careful not to touch the young
uh or-
oh yes there's a restaurant right there which is glass all around
oh yes there's a restaurant right there which is glass all around
so while you're eating you can watch-
uh this is a programme only in the morning where you can take photographs uh with the orangutan
when you are having uh dinner or lunch uh you don't have this programme available
but we have restaurants within the zoo in air-conditioned areas if you think it's too hot or you may want to sit outside
so there is uh- can you see the list of restaurants there
so that's a pizza joint
there's a
yes and ben and jerry's ice cream
yes and ben and jerry's ice cream
and ah ming is the name of our escort orangutan who has passed away
and she was given-
yes a female who was very popular and she's been buried at the zoo
if you like you can visit the burial spot
uh this is the restaurant there
i think may be a ye~ two years ago i'm not sure
yes
so because-
no this restaurant no was built much longer but it has been furbished
she was an ambassador
so if you want to eat quickly and uh move on then maybe you just eat just the area just outside the restaurant
and uh-
it's a big area and this is right where the orangutans are uh swinging around the trees uh so you can see uh the attractions and eat
you don't really waste time
okay so i'll show you the other attraction
so we also have a river safari first
so we also have a river safari first
let me show you this
this is the latest
it's within the zoo and you-
we have crocodiles in the zoo you can look at within like one metre two metres you know
so it's a good view
yes just opened
yes just opened
yah so-
yes the pandas can you see on the right-hand side
yes the pandas can you see on the right-hand side
they are not quite here yet
uh you have to wait for the announcements from the uh zoo
yes because they have to prepare the environment
uh pandas are very fussy about their food
they eat bamboo and we want to make sure that when they come here they are healthy they smile when you take photographs of them
yah
so it's impossible for us to see it because in the forest people would walk on it but you would be able to see this is dried out
because the keepers pick it up from the uh snake enclosure and then they dry it out
so you'd be able to see things like that
pictures of specimens uh i'm not sure
let me try conservation
yah
oh here you get a close up of the orangutan
yes
so i think this is another orangutan
uh ah ming is so famous
we all know her photo
and education because uh the zoo participates in helping not only um wildlife in singapore but also uh other places in the region
yah i um-
and so we have programmes for the schools where they go there and uh- it's a special programme where the
the keepers are trained to teach them to be uh aware of the need for a natural environment
yah
yes
you can see how many we have bred
orangutan golden lion tamarin uh
yes king cobra
uh we have a walk-in snake enclosure
uh do you like to see snakes close-up
uh do you like to see snakes close-up
uh if you don't have a phobia of it you can walk through because i have done it
uh the snakes are usually the tame variety the ones that don't move around and go after humans smell
so they are on the trees they are around you
so it's quite exciting uh to see
but otherwise you don't have to go through there yah
uh we have white rhino
yah and-
yes
malaysian- malayan tapir you can see close to you when we visit the night safari
so with this breeding programme we exchange some of the uh animals where we have uh very many with other zoos
oh no uh the zoo is for diurnal animals
that means those are uh active in the day
so it will close um uh about six i think
six about six yes
yes
and then you go to the zoo and the zoo is next door to the night safari that opens only at seven thirty
so you can eat if you're hungry your dinner at the zoo
and then just a short walk about ten minutes away across the car park to the night safari
or you can walk across to the night safari and there is a dining area that they allow you in earlier
yes
yes there are restaurants there and there are um something like fast food you know
uh burgers uh-
oh no not kfc
they both the zoo and the night safari and bird park they manage their own food and beverage
so uh where the restaurants are concerned uh they run the restaurants themselves
so if you see like ben and jerry's okay then they have allowed ben and jerry's to operate there
but the restaurants proper are run by wildlife reserves themselves
okay i come to the pricing in awhile
let me bring you to the uh night safari first
yes it's very famous
yes
so here you see remember the malayan tapir that you saw
they are also nocturnal and diurnal
that means you can see them in the day and at night active
yes uh-
you- the tram that is uh painted like a tiger it can bring you around the zoo- uh sorry the night safari
and then you-
yah you get off and here the leopard trail
yah you get off and here the leopard trail
yah you have to walk
yah for the giraffes you can see um just you know on the tram you can see because they're very tall
yah for the giraffes you can see um just you know on the tram you can see because they're very tall
but for the leopard you have to get off and walk
and uh we put some food nearby so that they will be there where there is light
so some people think- you see the background is very dark
yes
but you see when the leopards come- i think the leopards also think that the couple there is uh nice for eating you know
so they come near
uh but the glass is very strong
uh so where we have animals like tigers leopards lions
um the enclosure is very secure
uh yes
malayan tapir because it's indigenous to the region
and uh giraffes i think giraffes we just had baby giraffe if i'm not mistaken
yah
so sometimes the tapir will come in the front of the tram and then the tram cannot move
because it has to wait for the tapir to across the road
the only thing is you cannot take photographs when you're in the night safari
okay let-
leopard trail okay
let me show you the shows okay
yes this is creature of the night
yes this is creature of the night
it's very exciting
so you should-
okay here before you enter just now you saw a short flash of a tribal show
okay here before you enter just now you saw a short flash of a tribal show
yah
and yes the pictures keep changing we can't control that
uh so you can see the elephants
so this is a depiction of the tribes doing the dance with fire
uh you can volunteer for this also or- uh you need to very strong because that uh-
uh python is very heavy yes i couldn't carry it
uh python is very heavy yes i couldn't carry it
uh python is very heavy yes i couldn't carry it
and this is the leopard hand
uh after the show-
yes fire uh-
yes fires because the background is dark
yes fires because the background is dark
so with the fire you know fire eating
uh you'll be able to photograph very nicely
get good photographs
yes during the night uh you can visit the zoo and then you just walk across the road to the night safari
yes during the night uh you can visit the zoo and then you just walk across the road to the night safari
so uh i would recommend better to eat at the night safari because when you're eating uh
yah you see the show and if there is a long queue people buying tickets and you haven't bought your tickets yet uh you can queue up and buy the tickets first before other tourist groups come along
because the night safari is very popular
yes and uh to control the crowd as you are walking in we have uh-
yes
uh it depends on your size you know
uh that's right so big
but after the show okay i'm gonna show you- try and show you some pictures of the uh-
yah you see
so the whole night safari is divided into zones
so on the right side you can see the different zones
so as you pass by you'd be able to see these animals
okay
so from the himalayan foothills so this would be the animals you get at the himalayan foothills
the guide on the tram will draw your attention to where they are
yes
um this rhino looks as though he is wearing an armour
he's like- these are armour plated you know
like he is wearing a metal suit
it's a quite huge
uh well he's been here quite some years
but i don't know his exact age
uh this is a wolf i think
yup wolf
uh probably wild dogs descended from them
uh this one is indians sub continents
uh this one is indians sub continents
let see- so africa the african animals are very beautiful
and they have stripes uh colours
i'm afraid i don't know the name of this particular one uh-
yes it's from africa
yes it's from africa
so uh it's in the area of africa that is like singapore equatorial you know
so-
yah so can you see so it's hot and humid and red
so within that area we also re-create the zone
where we were uh the first slide we saw we try and build like cliffs for them
have you see the tigers
okay it should be coming up on your screen
in the day zoo you see the white tigers
have you heard of- yes it's a gene that is uh mutated long ago that they found in bangalore and then they bred it until we have a gene pool for tigers that come out white
so for
oh we have uh three white tigers
so there it's at the zoo
so you won't miss it
it will be on the trail as you are walking and so you can see their relatives here uh in the night safari
these are the natural-
yah natural
so tigers in fact uh can still be seen in malaysia our uh neighbouring country
but in singapore there is-
yah in the malayan region
yah in the malayan region
india and uh malayan
in singapore they are extinct already huh
we can't have them roaming down the streets
so- so here also so-
uh that's the one that's roaming around
you have seen it already
yah buffalo
yah buffalo
that's found still in burma
and we also have walking trails
yes that's right
uh yes different countries different continents uh-
yes
yes
okay
so if you are interested in all three attractions i suggest you buy a package ticket called the park hopper special
can you see it on your screen
yes that means you hop from park to park
yes that means you hop from park to park
you know what i mean
you- during uh for duration of one month thirty days you can use this ticket for all three parks
yes so you will not exceed the thirty days
yes so you will not exceed the thirty days
so-
so uh if i scroll down a little bit you can see uh- see if you just visit the night safari the admission plus the tram ride would be thirty two dollars
yes per person
but if you pay forty two that means only ten dollars more you'll get the bird park as well
but if you pay fifty eight then you can go to the singapore zoo
but if you pay fifty eight then you can go to the singapore zoo
park bird park night safari as well as the singapore zoo
but uh you want to go back to jurong bird park
i think it's uh bird park under twenty dollars
i think it's uh bird park under twenty dollars
for sure
less than that
you want to know the exact prices
you want to know the exact prices
you're not interested in the night safari or the zoo
let me see huh
okay
okay so yah i'm right twent- uh eighteen dollars
yes that is right
so if you take the panorail ride remember i told you it's the only panorail ride that brings you inside the uh bird aviary
where you saw the birds flying around
you add another five dollars then it would be twenty three dollars
you add another five dollars then it would be twenty three dollars
yes that's right
that are flying around yes
so just now you remember fifty eight dollars you visit three parks
so just now you remember fifty eight dollars you visit three parks
and here if you pay eighteen dollars you visit one park
and here if you pay eighteen dollars you visit one park
so if you don't want to take the ride it's only eighteen dollars
uh you're talking about all three
uh only one jurong bird park is twenty three dollars
uh only one jurong bird park is twenty three dollars
you buy the ticket in other words you decide at the time that you are buying the ticket and uh you just show the ticket
siloso beach if you are just swimming it's uh two dollars to enter the island an~
and then one dollar for um taking the shuttle bus from the bus bay outside uh the island
and then one dollar for um taking the shuttle bus from the bus bay outside uh the island
yes
when you come out you don't have to pay any money
so you still have lots of money leftover from your thousand dollars
so you still have lots of money leftover from your thousand dollars
uh lots of souvenirs you can buy when you're on siloso beach and also when you are at the zoo
at all the three parks and at sentosa you can buy lots of souvenirs
uh no not at jurong bird park but on sentosa there are hotels for you to stay
siloso beach you want to stay on the island
okay let me see
because we haven't found you a hotel yet have we
yes
you're only staying one night so we have uh lots of hotel
let's see
yah costa sands is my recommend-
yes costa sands
yes uh in fact sometimes singaporeans check-in there during the school holidays
because it's just along the beach
you can just walk down the beach
see it's on a hill overlooking siloso beach
yes you ca~ yes you can
it's like a regular resort
you just booked the rooms there
can you see the price here
so eighty nine
so eighty nine
off-peak up 'til two hundred and fifteen
off-peak up 'til two hundred and fifteen
so i guess it depends on the time
let me see whether i can get- no i can't get the rates there
let me see
yes that's for the hotel
can you see uh the- you only look at the one that says sentosa
the third one from your left
the third one from your left
just wait
i'm trying to find the dates for you
no downtown east is at another location
so when do you think you want to
yes definitely sentosa
then we can find out then- april- april five okay
april uh
oh sorry thursday
we were on march yes
we were on march yes
so five to six you're staying one night is that right
so five to six you're staying one night is that right
okay so let's check out the prices
you have to be-
yes off-peak because it's the middle of the week and it's also school term
and you see the school term
holiday is in uh may yah
it's in may
so you want to know the rate
okay
uh so one room with uh twin beds or double beds
oh you need to stay two nights
oh you need to stay two nights
because the maximum prices of the room is only two hundred over dollars
because the maximum prices of the room is only two hundred over dollars
yah so you said you have a thousand to spend
yah so you said you have a thousand to spend
so can you see the pricing on your screen
yes it's daily rate so it would be two to nine
yes much cheaper
yah yes
yes a minimum of two nights
it's uh less than half the price
it's uh less than half the price
uh it's during the time that you want to go that is the price
are you able to extend your stay
because one night is not really enough time for singapore
and you have a lot of money for singap~
yah because you can stay there you can spend a whole day at the beach and visit the underwater world i was telling you about
um i'm adding up the cost
uh so twenty three for your bird park uh twenty five for underwater world
yah well including the one dollar is three dollars
that's why i say uh you have lots of money
yes huh
of course we won't do the bookings now
okay
so you can see how much money you are spending
okay
and maybe we add-in- let say it's a big um figure you will get your change back for taking the uh mass rapid transit to travel around by train and the bus
so allow thirty dollars per person
yes
so-
you're welcome
and i hope you'll come back and visit uh singapore for more days
thank you very much
bye bye amil
bye bye
hello
good afternoon
i'm jeanne guide number two from singapore
may i know your name
number thirty nine
jen is it j e n
jen is it j e n
okay
uh how can i help you jen
your budget is more than enough for- because two days is only one night
so you can in fact stay two nights
uh but i need to know who are you travelling with please
so you're bringing your friend okay
so you're bringing your friend okay
how many of uh- sorry
so two of you only is it
and it's a girl you are travelling with
okay and you are in your twenties i assume
oh you sounded a very young thirty then okay
well you're still young at thirty so it's not a problem huh
uh can i know um what are your preferences
what do you normally enjoy uh back home
what do you normally enjoy uh back home
well we have resort hotels on sentosa island
but uh for two nights it might be a little bit uh costly unless you stay uh on the beach front
uh we have a more affordable hotel on the beach front that i can recommend to you so you can walk around the island and enjoy the beaches as well
uh we have a more affordable hotel on the beach front that i can recommend to you so you can walk around the island and enjoy the beaches as well
is that suitable for you
okay
okay the city lights uh the architecture is very uh accessible from the island because uh this island is off the south of singapore and it's also uh you know connected by train and by road
so let me show you a map of singapore so that you have an idea of locations
and then you can uh make up your mind if you like that or not
so can you get the map on your screen
okay
so i'm trying to enlarge it for you
so here you see singapore with its neighbouring country malaysia to the north of us
so we are an island surrounded by water
and the island i'm suggesting you stay is right down south
in the south
in the middle of the island right at the bottom
you saw that
okay across from there there are two islands
and the bigger island is sentosa island
okay so now you can see it
uh these are roads
and later i'll show you a map of the subway system
which is also integrated with the bus system uh at bus interchanges at there
which is also integrated with the bus system uh at bus interchanges at there
there are lots of people using public transport
so it's very easy to move around in singapore
yah
yes uh in fact i suggest you take the train because it's faster and it's uh-
so by distance the trains are more expensive to set up
so it would be a little bit more expensive for journeys
and bus journeys uh will be under a dollar
uh this is just a rough guide
let me show you where uh the airport of singapore is and with the train connections
so mrt is the mass rapid transit
and that is the name of our uh subway which is also above ground in certain parts
that one i don't think you'll be taking
it leads people right up to the doorstep
so- can you see uh number three on the map
yes on the right
yes on the right
so this is the eastern tip of the island
and that is our airport international airport
so if you come in here and you go down to the basement there is an office that will sell you the tickets for the subway
and you can put value in it
in fact you have to put value in it so that uh as you use the subway and the passes
the value is deducted
so they a tour advantages you don't have to worry about the fare and you also don't- you also get a discount
every time you connect the journey uh you'll get a discount
so it makes it very attractive
yes that's right
uh the card is called the ez-link card
yah it is the size of a credit card
yah it is the size of a credit card
and it's a contactless card
so you just tap it at the sensor when you are entering the stations
and if you are in the bus you must remember to tap it when you get off the bus
because otherwise uh the system will assume that you've taken the journey right up to the end
because they are not reading anything on your card
so you tap in and you tap out
so that's what you need to do
okay huh
so that is very easy uh and you can get the cards
uh well for me at the airport for you is the most convenient
but if uh you suddenly travel all over singapore you have used up all the value
uh you can go to a seven eleven store that's open twenty four hours and you just put in a little bit more money
no it's not extra you're just putting value into the card
so uh this makes it convenient because seven eleven stores are all over singapore
uh even at petrol stations
so you- if you should run out of money in the card
but usually i suggest that people uh put in more than enough and then when they leave go back to the officer and get your refund uh before you leave
so you don't have to worry about it
uh you can also use the card for sightseeing
i use the trains to go all around singapore uh and once we're out of the city it is above ground so you can see all around you
yah the only thing is we came back to her hotel so which was uh it showed on the card that we had uh travelled only maybe one-stop away because we stop one-stop away from her hotel
and we have to pay two dollars surcharge
this is to discourage people using the system uh to make friends chit chat inside you know the train station so 'cause they are very comfortable
um so where do you want to live in singapore
um so where do you want to live in singapore
where do you want to stay
uh so you want a beach hotel or you want to stay in an ethnic area
one is chinatown and one is little in~
a few churches in fact uh within the area because we are multi-cultural and multi-religious
also in chinatown at the heart of chinatown in fact it's one of older hindu temples which is also a national monument
and our oldest chinese temple is there and it's all within walking distance
but you won't get your greenery around there you know
so if you want a greenery you want a resort view then it would be sentosa island
okay where price is concerned uh little india and chinatown has uh lower priced hotels
because in their locations the rents are lower than in the island
uh so on the island i think about two hundred dollars you should be able to get a hotel a decent size hotel
which is also a good rate
which is also a good rate
where you share the bed with other people
where you share the bed with other people
yah so if you want to have a room to yourself about eighty to a hundred sixty uh you should be able to get a decent size uh room in chinatown
yes per night yes
uh meals it depends on the hotel
some of them do not provide meals because all around where the hotel is there are food outlets
so sometimes it not worth the while to provide the meal
in little india you can get hotels in this price range and even cheaper
in little india you can get hotels in this price range and even cheaper
so uh what sort of food do you enjoy
safe food so- in- uh safe food so do you have chinese food in your country
uh so-
yah indian food the only problem is if you take too much chili and some people can find it too hot on the tongue
so-
okay so we will check out the hotels in chinatown
okay so we will check out the hotels in chinatown
and we'll show you a variety and with their prices
and so you can have a look
chinatown is busy day and night but they have other uh they have hotels along the small streets they have hotels along the main road
so i can tell you from the location whether it's a quieter part of chinatown or not
and here you can soak up the atmosphere
okay
uh if you're thinking of regular size hotels you know the normal idea of hotel it would be furama city centre
can you see uh on the screen
so eu tong seng street is one of the main road in chinatown
uh below that you see another road called keong saik road and that is a small lane off the major roads of chinatown and it's on the quieter side of chinatown
also bukit pasoh and here you can see the hotel price it is also like a business hotel rate huh
yes so i think uh we will not consider that right
what do you think
okay i thought you would like the money for shopping or some other thing huh
so it's about same price
even better we have this one along the side street the inn at temple street
can you see it
uh that's only one eight
and below a hundred keong saik hotel
uh the quieter side of town
on the quieter side also at the bottom we have scarlet hotel but you can see the price it's two six five
it is a-
yes it's luxury class yah
so uh porcelain hotel is on the main road
so uh maybe a little bit busier when you come out
so uh maybe a little bit busier when you come out
so it's your choice whether you want to be just off the main street or you would like to be in the- on the main road because off the main street you just walk out and five minutes you're into the shopping area into where the restaurants the cafés the street side shopping is
off the main road is also maybe three four minutes away
off the main road
okay let's have a look again
okay
so furama city centre is off because that is main road
okay off the main road we have i think at uh the upper end is the hotel nineteen twenty nine and it's very popular it's very trendy
it was one of the first hotels in chinatown converted out of places where people use to shop
uh start to shop downstairs and live upstairs
uh we have- the most affordable here the attractive price is the keong saik hotel
uh and the other one is the inn at temple street
uh temple street you are actually uh in the heart of uh where people eat and uh shop
so it's like you go downstairs and there are shops all around
okay so you want to be in the heart of the action but not along the main road right
okay so let me write this down the inn at temple street
and the name temple street is because there is one of our oldest hindu temples uh over there
so let me show you
there you go
if you want to book alright
uh when are you deciding to come
first week of april
uh i think prices withhold yes
uh it would goes up a little bit in april huh
yah one hundred so about twelve dollars more
uh that's okay
uh you look at the price here
so whether you are by yourself or with your friend it's the same price a hundred and thirty dollars
so you can afford two nights
right
yes so that would be two hundred and sixty dollars
yes so that would be two hundred and sixty dollars
okay
so that you have a better uh idea of where you are staying huh
so this is the outside the facade of the hotel
and this is the lobby
yes all the hotels along this little streets are converted shop houses
uh and well this may not be a shop house itself it could be a clubhouse or whatever
and it's like it's the same as your hotel although i haven't check up on this particular address
so the hoteliers un undertook a conservation of the building by restoring it and- so the inside was changed
uh previously uh there was one staircase leading down
and there were very- it was very cramp
there would be little cubicles where people live
but here you see it's like a regular small boutique hotel
so instead of the shop you have a lobby your reception area uh as you enter
yes very classy
so it's quite a bargain for a hundred and thirty dollars right
so it's quite a bargain for a hundred and thirty dollars right
and from that little table and chair they have tried to put some of the older furniture which has become very popular nowadays huh so you can see the room has got a bathroom attached
right so this is acceptable for you
okay uh would you like to see some of the food you can get
uh in chinatown since you are not getting breakfast
uh what we like to eat in singapore which is uh nutritious and tasty is called kaya toast
uh what we like to eat in singapore which is uh nutritious and tasty is called kaya toast
uh kaya is-
yah
yes kaya k a y a
it is uh- uh i don't know whether you can call it a jam
it is made of uh coconut
we squeeze out the juice and then we put in eggs and uh natural fragrance called pandans leaves
so it is cooked and it's stirred constantly and in the old days this was done by hand
i don't know even now whether they have a machine to do it
you can see it there uh a shop that is very well known called yakun to-
yah
uh can you see here spread the word
so they have made the recipe out of uh coconut milk sugar eggs and pandan
so it's natural no artificial colouring or flavouring
the flavour is from the leaves
in fact i just had uh their breakfast this morning
and here it's like a little café
nothing fancy but very affordable
so you can put kaya on it or you can just put butter
or cheese
so instead of ham and eggs or bacon and eggs i think this is more traditional for us and maybe you want to try it
yah lucky i had lunch
yah lucky i had lunch
uh here the bottom and they do it perfectly
the eggs
you know soy sauce made from soya bean
so the dark kraft is very thick
they use quality uh dark soy sauce and if you like you can put in a lot of pepper
uh i like to swallow the yolk whole and that's yes
so i eat the whites and then i swallow the whole yolk it's very yummy
but-
oh yes well i don't eat that everyday uh just a treat once in a while
and uh you- so to finish up you can have the kaya on toast
so you have it's like a desert you know what i mean
uh that would be maybe in the afternoon
when it's a bit warm so singaporeans get off the street they want something to pamper themselves without spending too much so they will uh ask for ice cream toast kaya toast or butter sugar
have you tried that
you butter the toast bread and then you sprinkle sugar on it
it's not good for your diet but yummy
no you- yah
just two days you know uh uh yakun outlets are all over singapore and you can find them in shopping centres you can find them along the roadsides you know where you're shopping
so you want the hotels in little india
okay the beach one
alright the sentosa hotels
and they also have resorts style very classy hotels
so there is a choice
in singapore we have lots of choices
so uh on the list there you can see some uh resort hotels
you don't want resort hotels so you can uh scroll down and find one uh sentosa beach hotel
let's try and get the hotels again okay
it's uh loading now
okay
let me find it for you
okay
okay there are two we can look at
okay there are two we can look at
there is costa sands and there is also siloso beach
and here we have costa sands
wait
you're having a view of the place
okay
so costa sands let's look at the rates
uh let me see
uh just on the side bar it's eighty nine dollars to two hundred and fifteen dollars yes
and there can you see it here uh they have another hotel elsewhere
so we have to make sure that we put you on sentosa island
so you said april do you have a date for april
okay
okay we get the april month for you
april- uh we have march there we'll get down to april
so the first of april is uh sunday
if it's two nights you'll stay till the third is that right
or do you want to go another day in april
which da~ april seventh okay we'll try for april seventh
so it's a weekend also
april seventh and departing on the ninth is that right
so it's saturday till monday
so you have the weekend there
oh i'm sorry they have no room
there is a the calendar and then you can see the actual day you want to have
april five that's a thursday
april five that's a thursday
okay
there are no room oh no rooms
sorry i looked at it okay
uh i think your other friends have booked it already
do you want to get okay
uh wait
you try another date further down in april
you try another date further down in april
eleventh to thirteenth
and we see whether you have luck this time
so here can you see the rates
uh kampong hut is a small structure it supposed to uh resemble the uh but you see the deluxe room that's a deluxe room that you are seeing over there
okay
so that is the difference
uh you have a look at it the rooms have definitely air-conditioned for the uh one that's a hundred and eighty nine dollars
uh let's see okay
because forty nine dollars uh is a little too attractive let say for a beachfront
because forty nine dollars uh is a little too attractive let say for a beachfront
i used to do that when i was uh in school
i used to do that when i was uh in school
so you open the windows and you can hear the water you can hear uh the crickets in the background you know
uh i mean if i were the visitor
so uh you can see that uh there's a swimming pool
but of course i think you- perhaps want to swim in the sea
and for some people if they don't like the salt water then they can also use the pool
yes you can use both
i think this is the kampong hut here
yes
so here it is
i'll try and find out for you
i don't know why it doesn't say whether it's air-conditioned or not
but you see it's all closed in
you get what i mean
so um
yes probably it is
uh so uh you still get your air conditioning but i think the size of the place is perhaps a little bit smaller
uh no i think two people if you're not gonna spend a lot of time in the room it should not be a problem
okay it's air-conditioned
uh and you also- okay the only difference and this is the catch you- there's a common toilet and shower facilities nearby
so you'll- yes you have to share
so in fact the room isn't that small because you can have two double-decker beds and that means if you came with three other friends you'll still be able to stay there
so some people on tight budget that's what they'll do
they save their money for shopping or eating
that's why you know the price is so low
it is even under fifty dollars
uh what-
you're going with the deluxe room okay
so this is the deluxe room uh very classy huh
so here you see the hotel
so there's the neighbouring carts
okay so the deluxe room- uh let's have a look at the rates for the deluxe room
uh the deluxe room then would give you more space uh more uh comfort level
and you also feel more like a tourist okay
we have to find out if it's available
what date was it your-
yah eleventh to thirteenth okay
eleventh to thirteenth
okay here you are it's a hundred and eighty nine dollars
so that would be the standard deluxe
so i can see you like some luxury
we can put it at let's say hundred and ninety dollars times two um that's uh three hundred and eighty dollars for your rooms alright
and so then you'll be on the beachfronts and there are forest walks that you can do there okay
so what about sightseeing what are your preferences
so what about sightseeing what are your preferences
what sort of things that would you like to see whilst you're here
oh yes uh we have a botanic gardens that is very well-known
uh i'll get you the information on the botanic gardens
and uh it's a huge place and most people uh when they don't have too much time they visit the orchids okay
because the- within the orchid enclosure we have many- orchids that are in bloom that are on display
we also have a little forest uh right near to where the orchids are
and it's a very uh what should i say
and it's a very uh what should i say
very comfortable forest because you can walk on a pathway and uh you see huge trees over a hundred and fifty years old right next to you but uh you don't have to step on mud
so it's quite comfortable
and we have also a ginger garden within the area
and these areas are very near to each other
so besides the ginger that you use for cooking we have also you know colourful flowers that people use to decorate hotel rooms uh their own houses if they have a big uh living room
uh you see the band stand there that dates
right over a hundred years
uh let me show you okay the hours the visiting hours
so- oh yes to the gardens it's free
a very good news
a very good news
and uh you- because that's special that's very special yah
so i'm talking about the national orchid garden
it's five dollars
and this section closes at seven
but you could go jogging around the garden till twelve midnight
yes uh and you can go for romantic walk you know if you had bought your boyfriend along
uh but you and-
uh huh you can bring a girl
they go there and they jog and uh so it's nice also to have a look at other things besides the flowers there
this is only if you see the orchids
uh if you are visiting the forest the ginger garden uh ecological garden it is all free of charge yah
um and your friend is an adult
so you cannot visit jacob ballas
it's a children's garden
uh okay
oh okay if you are serious about botany there is a very good library okay
uh we can- this part of the gardens you can approach by bus uh and just walk there
it's very easy to visit
now let me show you the attractions
we have there also um very old tree
uh let me go to the tanglin halt
okay this is the map of the area
so if you were to visit the gardens uh okay
if you want to see sculptures you walk the other way
that is actually the cotton tree we call it the kapok tree
and if you are lucky-
yes it's- i don't know if you are familiar with this when babies were born we didn't want to give them polyester filled pillows so there were people who collect uh the cotton that is inside the pod and then it's save up to make a pillow for the baby
and the tree is very huge there and many people like to take photographs there
so today it's one of our heritage tree so we try to protect it
uh further down is another tall tree here also a heritage tree
uh that would be where the uh ginger garden and the orchids is located okay
okay so it's nice to get in from there and then uh you can see all the other parts of the gardens and then this is the ginger garden
can you see burkill gates
on the left
yah so- lots of colourful uh plants there
and as you proceed up uh it's a very short road inside the gardens
you see national orchid garden at the top
you see national orchid garden at the top
so that is where we have uh the orchids
so maybe if you provide um three hours to go to the gardens and you know you can also walk the forest
and then you would have seen maybe only half of the gardens
yah so this is the biggest garden the oldest and the most popular in singapore
so
it's only just- it's free yes uh uh i'll show you some heritage trees or they have don't- let me see if there are pictures
oh this is just may be for scientist to know uh the size of the tree and also where it's located
yah so no pictures not so interesting okay
so botanic gardens is a must see yes
if you enjoy uh gardens
but we don't have a sector on- let me see
they don't feature the forest
it's not the attraction but let's have a look at bukit timah
okay here if you are interested in herbs and spices
so here it's uh what we call an economic garden
you can see nuts and beverages crops
because originally when the british came the gardens was used to experiment to see which spice trees what useful plants could be grown here
so we've-
uh not nuts and fruits but uh souvenirs like- but within the national orchid garden uh we have a company called risis
it i~ the first company to come up with the technology to encase a real flower and uh preserve it
and you can use it as a pendant or a brooch
and of course that shop has other souvenirs as well
but the spices uh the herbs is more for educational purposes
we have uh plant sales but i think the gardens gets nurseries to sell their plants there
so we also do research here
so i think they not so keen on the commercial side of the business
yah
so this is the gardens for you
what else would you like to see in singapore
what else would you like to see in singapore
is that all or you want to have uh other areas uh whether it's museums or natural places
i can find for you
zoos okay we try and get the zoo for you
the zoo is part of a three attractions that is run by wildlife reserves in singapore
so here i'm gonna open up and let you see
also within the zoo uh bird park and night safari which are the three attractions
they are like gardens because of the landscaping
but the landscaping is more towards the natural environment of the inhabitants
so like here were plants um fruit trees for the birds and tall shady trees and where the same trees are found in africa and can survive in singapore we also got them
this is uh waterfall aviary it's a walk in aviary
that means you actually can - you can be inside with the birds you know what i mean
yes
so uh you can feel very close-up to them
it's not like you're looking at the cage
the birds are free flying
and we also have the largest waterfall uh that is man-made in this area which is also good for photography
and as far as i know it's the only panorail that enters a bird aviary
so when you get off the tram you're already inside this aviary
so when you get off the tram you're already inside this aviary
and you can see the birds feeding you can uh wait
if you map your tour according to the feeding times you can feed them
yah
so this is the day attraction
so the zoo is also a day attraction
in other words it closes in the evening on about six o'clock
and here we have- have you see this creature bef~
yes i haven't seen it myself but i must go there just to see it
uh they call it naked i think-
rats usually have fur but this one doesn't have fur
and the teeth are used for tunnelling
this is just one of the attractions there
have you seen orangutans before
national geographic yes
well here you can see uh they are free-ranging in other words uh up on the trees they are swinging around and one of the highlights is uh if you have breakfast-
it's very safe because these are breed in the zoo
and uh they are tamed uh
but it's glass all around so you can look out and you can see the orangutans
their free-ranging area is right there
so for twenty nine dollars uh in the morning if you go so the outside area is ah meng terrace named after an ambassador uh who was an a female orangutan called ah meng
and you'd be able to have breakfast and at the same time you can- after your breakfast take a photograph with the orangutan
uh they don't really pose they are sitting there
and uh i haven't seen an orangutan smile
uh if you are lucky there is a baby and then you can see uh the mother and the baby
so if their baby is there don't touch the baby
you know mothers are naturally protective of the babies
so this is bigger picture
and it will have fruits like uh bananas durian
do you know durian
they're smelly but it's very delicious uh very creamy and it will be eating that
and they also now bring out other animals out uh with their handlers
so if you want to go near uh touch or take photograph uh you check with the handler and the handler will know the mood of the animal at that time
usually they bring the ones that are very uh visitor friendly
so this is one of the things that you can see uh at the zoo in the day time yah
uh i'll show you uh the shows let me see huh
no let me see the animal appearance
this is a very handsome python called the golden python
and it's with the handler so uh if you- uh do you like snakes or are you-
uh do you like snakes or are you-
it's good to take this opportunity to just feel it it's very smooth it's cold
no they won't attack you the keeper is there and in this picture you can see it is holding up you know the snake quite well
um sometimes at the visitor sites other visitor sites outside the zoo we have uh snake charmers who have their own cobras
uh and if you are afraid of touching the head you can touch the tail
that's what some of my tourist do
that's what some of my tourist do
uh sorry not cobra i said the wrong thing
phy-
we used to have what we called the black mamba that looks like a cobra but they stop using that because the tourist uh were frightened
but uh the mamba it's actually a tame variety which the people bring in
but at the zoo uh they have the golden pythons whose uh habit is only to wind themselves around uh you know if they catch something they want to it they wind themselves around it
so it's not a problem yah
uh let's see if we can see other attractions
here we go
so you are looking at all the animals
this is a family of orangutans
we have crocodiles and monitor lizards
okay let through
these are the more exciting animals
here we have the leopards and uh we also have here elephants
uh fragile forest is where you can see- see this one you have to go to madagascar to see so yah
uh fragile forest is where you can see- see this one you have to go to madagascar to see so yah
this is also like the walking aviary
it is a forest that you walk-in to
there's a huge net around it
it's a big area and as you're walking around you can take photographs of these animals yah
we also have polar bears and there's a polar bear show
so this one looks like the singaporean polar bear who was born here
hm yes
yes uh
okay show one more to tempt you further
it is a white tiger and it's due to a mutant gene uh found in indian and reproduced
so uh many people- see not only the regular tiger but the white tiger okay
so uh let me try to get you to the price of the night safari
uh sorry the price of the zoo uh although we do have uh package ticket where you see the several parks and you get some discount
uh sorry the price of the zoo uh although we do have uh package ticket where you see the several parks and you get some discount
so here we go
i told you that it's run by wildlife saf~ uh reserves
so we have uh special pricing with discount built in
if you visit two attractions uh you get a discount
see if you visit the zoo alone that is twenty dollars
do you see there
uh if you add-in the night safari it's forty two
and if you combine it with the bird park it is thirty two
so it's only up to you you know um how much time you have and uh what you want to see
yes zoo botanic gardens uh you can even do the night safari it's next to the zoo
now you can do a lot and you have a lot more money left uh to do shopping

m a r l o w e with an extra e
okay i thought it's like marlon brando
okay i thought it's like marlon brando
my name is jeanne j e a n n e and i'm tour guide number two
how may i help you marlowe
for~ uh that's the september period
ah but uh do you want to settle where you want to live first where you want to stay
okay yes
okay yes
that's very wise because if you take public transports um some of the roads are closed off because it is uh what you call it
the approach roads to the venue
okay there is a beach road hotel and beach road is just adjacent to the race track and it's very near
oh yes of course
this hotel is not the high priced one
there are high priced ones where uh right on the race track
uh those prices uh are much higher during the period of the race because that's you know um-
but here we have- uh okay
can you see on the screen
yes that's uh it's very sensible because it is uh- you know in the same location as parkroyal and of course raffles hotel is eight hundred dollars that's a five-star
yah okay
reach yes
do you have the dates or do you want us to find the dates for you the formula one race
yes
usually it's uh last weekend i think it's the third weekend at the end of the month
uh it is the twenty first twenty second and twenty third
for this year okay
um okay
uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it's near impossible it will be fully booked already
yah
so uh if you book now here it says a hundred and thirty dollars book this
so uh if you book now here it says a hundred and thirty dollars book this
uh when are you- i mean how are you travelling
are you with a friend or are you coming alone
are you with a friend or are you coming alone
so it's just one single room huh
uh it's actually the same price if you see here
so let see if uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds
so let see if uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds
okay
september- you want to come in on the twenty first
september- you want to come in on the twenty first
uh yes that's ideal
yes
you could even walk around you know and have a look at the place
because that would be after the race
okay 2012
and you only want one room right
okay
so let's have a look
we have to wait for the response and see if they have rooms or uh what sort of price
they have put there normally that's uh you know it's a hundred and thirty dollars if you book now
so uh-
yes
in singapore we are very greedy nation we are eating all the time
uh okay
there's a market that is uh very near you within walking distance and if i walk the same distance because when i go by bus my bus stop somewhere near there
there's a market that is uh very near you within walking distance and if i walk the same distance because when i go by bus my bus stop somewhere near there
and uh there you can get uh local food
uh i'm not sure if i can get you- uh whether they have uh a website because this- it's what we used to call a hawker centre but we don't have hawker centre uh so it's called a food centre and it's called the beach road
uh i'm not sure if i can get you- uh whether they have uh a website because this- it's what we used to call a hawker centre but we don't have hawker centre uh so it's called a food centre and it's called the beach road
okay
yes
uh around the hotel also uh there are places that you can come out and eat and if you want something in an air-conditioned place there's also a food centre uh nearby at raffles city which is a big convention and exhibition centre
but you know many people work there and uh they can't afford to be you know going out to markets to look for food
but you know many people work there and uh they can't afford to be you know going out to markets to look for food
so at these food centres you'll get decent food local food and at affordable prices
so at these food centres you'll get decent food local food and at affordable prices
uh i don't know about cheaper price but uh i know that during the race uh uh they do have vendors uh offer their souvenirs
uh because in singapore we protects uh copyright so i'm not sure that you can get uh sort of like imitation of the real stuff
you won't be able to get it i don't think so
uh the market i'm talking about it doesn't have uh a website but i can describe to you what they have there
yes
uh let me see beach road
um hm let me see
oops sorry
no i think they are attractions
no it's urban development authority so it's not a bus stop okay
but your market is just down the way
and if you want non-souvenir uh non~ sorry non-race souvenirs you can do shopping along arab street
this whole area is a conservation area
and just beyond sultan gate is the market that i'm talking about
do you know um satay or kebab
are you familiar with kebab
are you familiar with kebab
alright
so our version of it here in uh southeast asia is satay we called it s a t a y
and here you can see the vendors- they have different kinds of meats
uh these are at beach road you get the uh malay version of it with peanut sauce
and so you wouldn't be getting any pork satay you would be getting uh chicken beef and uh mutton
okay
if you like spicy uh there are other spicy dishes i can introduce you
these are more sweet they are usually marinated to be sweet
and the sauce is peanut sauce gravy you see the little bowl that is there
and you eat it with rice that has been cooked and- traditionally they used leaves to weave a little basket to cook it
but sometimes they put it in a tube and then it comes out sort of circular form and it sliced up
now you also get uh- sorry you were gonna say
and uh fresh onions
so if- since you are travelling alone you are not gonna offend anybody that's not very sweet okay
so-
uh so this is one of the favourite dishes uh and you can eat there
okay
uh because the flyer is located uh within view of the race track and uh the flyer is uh very slow moving
so you get uh time to soak in the view not only the race track but the surrounding area
if i am uh not mistaken it is only twenty nine dollars
if i am uh not mistaken it is only twenty nine dollars
yes
so can you see it here
and the race track is just nearby
uh if you uh don't mind walking you can walk there you know
uh if you uh don't mind walking you can walk there you know
it's nice to walk because uh it's by the river and it's- lots of things to see and uh enjoy while you're uh doing your walk
i'm a walking sort of tourist okay
gonna show you the flyer now
okay
so you're seeing just a little bit of it at the corner there
uh this advertisement they are trying to encourage you to uh take in a tour but here- there you can see
you can- the butler of course this one is uh not so cheap huh
fifteen dollars if you can prove you're a student but uh i don't think you're a student right
are you uh-
are you uh-
uh not anymore
uh not anymore
so marlowe i'm afraid you have to pay uh twenty nine dollars uh
so marlowe i'm afraid you have to pay uh twenty nine dollars uh
uh singapore sling is a cocktail that was concocted at the raffles hotel
it's got gin angostura bitters and- you know if you pay extra you can enjoy your meal or you can have uh a drink
it's got gin angostura bitters and- you know if you pay extra you can enjoy your meal or you can have uh a drink
yah so i think- yah so you just be prepared to pay a little bit more
there are places where you can eat there
there are places where you can eat there
uh this is- wait a minute
wait
uh so this is the cocktail flight
you are given the cocktail but it is not the singapore sling it's their own
i think they have created something else green in colour
because the uh singapore sling is pinkish red in colour
so you're looking at the capsule now
yes that's right
there is uh place where you can buy things
there is uh place where you can buy things
so-
so dining on the flyer i think this is chilli crab let me try and get it for you
because you say you like something hot right
uh one of our iconic dishes here that many people like to eat is chilli crab
yah you enjoy crabs right
you don't have any allergy or anything
uh it is crabs cooked with chilli and uh what do you call it
um tomato sauce
and if you don't mind eating with your fingers i always recommend that it's finger licking good
um yah
that's where you can uh have it
oh we are getting uh sound
we'll try and cancel this
yah that's-
alright okay
yah
okay
do you want to see anything else
oh then i recommend the raffles hotel because that is a very historic hotel
uh that is a national monument and-
so- usually it's the british who know about this hotel because they were our colonial rulers before independence
but this hotel here people often go in and take photographs
uh and we have there a place called the long bar
where the reception of the hotel is now uh it's all been changed but the long bar used to be right at the front of the hotel and it was the longest bar in the whole world at one time
okay
but-
yes
they have lots of mixes but the people who go there uh they go for the singapore sling
because the sling was created there at the hotel
by their bartender
yes that's right
so you're getting it uh from the place itself it's very special
and they- they won't sort of clean up your glass and give it to you they give you a new one uh nicely packaged
yes we have a zoo it is out of town but because of where you're staying near the uh subway station
you can take the subway and then you can connect
uh yes that would be very easy
but just let me show you the zoo first because it's coming out from the screen
it's in the north of singapore and where the race is held is in the south of singapore
but you can connect uh to the nearest big town and there you take a bus that will bring you directly to the zoo where the few stops along uh housing areas
so it's also a good opportunity for you to see the type of housing singaporeans live in the scenery of you know the natural neighbourhoods that you see
you will not be in the business area when you take this bus that connects you uh from the uh train station to the bu~
uh zoo
'cause the zoo is where not many people live it is in uh a reserve that is uh to help us to collect rain water
it's next to a reservoir and that's why it is so attractive
yes there is also a night safari uh but you will be watching your show right
so it's either the night safari or you're gonna see your race
oh yah
watch the race and either you extend the date or you come back another time for it
watch the race and either you extend the date or you come back another time for it
yes that's a good idea
let me just show you uh some of the attractions
so what we do is we plan it so that it's not only the animal on show you get a little bit of the natural environment
so what we do is we plan it so that it's not only the animal on show you get a little bit of the natural environment
this is part of uh the australian outback so we've got wallabies there
we'll go through quickly so i can tell you about the uh the card that you asked me about
we'll go through quickly so i can tell you about the uh the card that you asked me about
cat country
don't they look loveable
and i think these are mousedeers huh
they are-
have you seen them before
so it's called a mousedeer
and- the enclosure is just at the entrance so it's very near for you to see
then we have elephants
uh i thought you knew it more than uh i thought you did
it's- i shouldn't tell you because uh actually it's during the show
uh so if you sits at a certain place you might get a little bit of a shower that's all
they are- they do- uh the show is not doing tricks it's just-
uh the show is not doing tricks it's just- naturally they heave heavy logs in some countries so they are like work elephants
so here their mahouts which is the name of their trainer help them- teach them you know how to continue doing this so that people will understand
so here their mahouts which is the name of their trainer help them- teach them you know how to continue doing this so that people will understand
and here-
mahouts is the name of the handler
these are um lemurs that you naturally have to go to madagascar to see
and the industries called fragile forest which is uh a forest area that's encased in netting
so we also have some free flight birds there and butterflies
so you know because animals move around and so if you uh want you can click as many as you like with them doing different things
yah okay
here we have some baboons they are hamadryas baboons
there's a place that's uh covered and with glass
so if you don't want to see them in the open where you're protected by a mode you go to the glass covered area
so if you don't want to see them in the open where you're protected by a mode you go to the glass covered area
and if the male baboon thinks you look like uh somebody who will court his wife he will come charging at you
and if the male baboon thinks you look like uh somebody who will court his wife he will come charging at you
yah it's quite exciting because uh you know it's so near but you are protected by the glass so it's fun
uh sometimes- no i wouldn't recommend that you do yah
uh so the zoo is precautious it will not uh take any risk with anybody
orang-utans in the wild if you see them also don't go near them because they have very- they are very strong
orang-utans in the wild if you see them also don't go near them because they have very- they are very strong
but once in the zoo some of them have been bred here they are singapore citizens
so- uh at the breakfast show you can take photographs with them
and they're in a uh open area so they are swinging from tree to tree very near you
you will just pay a small fee
so have you seen polar bears before
so you don't have to go to a cold place and you can see the polar bear and uh still be in the equatorial area
uh there's a show in the morning and you can see him catching fish and al- so hitting a ball high up so they have been trained
of course they have an air-conditioned area where they can sleep if they like
of course they have an air-conditioned area where they can sleep if they like
this is one of the handsome occupants of primate kingdom
sure
sure
uh you will be able to because in the primate kingdom again it's open but uh the animals are in separate islands so that the species do not mix
and they have uh water mode is that little islands within an area and they have trees where they can climb up and down
and they have uh water mode is that little islands within an area and they have trees where they can climb up and down
uh the only thing is they don't know how to smile at you
yes
the only thing is don't be enthusiastic and jump over if you are a long jumper
uh you shouldn't be able to get through uh because if you enter any of these uh areas then the animals are likely to be defensive because you are encroaching on their home
uh okay
yah
so if you go you must take picture of this one it's a proboscis monkey
this one is in a different environment because it comes from the forest of borneo it's very shy
i saw it for thirty seconds in its natural environment when i went over to borneo
so they gave us some and they have bred successfully
and the thing is um you see this uh nose hanging down
for the male the nose grows long it hangs down and for some reason the females think the longer the nose the handsomer he is
uh yes that's right
and the proboscis therefore refers to the length of the nose
if they are breeding at the time you may see a female with uh baby and that's really thrilling
uh no they are not shy yah
lots of tourists have taken photographs of them
i think they get used to the environment
you're not going to kidzworld so i will skip that
uh do you like snakes
uh do you like snakes
uh are you-
okay you just want to see them
we have a reptile garden
uh yah it's within the area where we have crocodiles uh uh monitor lizards and uh komodo dragons
uh yah it's within the area where we have crocodiles uh uh monitor lizards and uh komodo dragons
uh yah it's within the area where we have crocodiles uh uh monitor lizards and uh komodo dragons
if i'm not mistaken this is a komodo dragon uh normally found in some islands in indonesia
if i'm not mistaken this is a komodo dragon uh normally found in some islands in indonesia
uh it- it is fully enclosed so you choose whether you want to go in
so if you enter through the gate you'll find snakes coiled around tree trunks and you can take photographs
no they specially select these uh snakes so the species is specially selected
so you you walk on a wooden walkway and- uh so it's quite fun
uh and then you just walk out- uh you enter by one gate and you enter- you exit by another
safe very safe
safe very safe
uh if i can go through it anybody else can
uh so this is african region with lions
so even if you um don't walk you can see the lions if you just take a tram right around
the lions- we have quite a few i forget how many but some of them maybe in a place that's uh good for photos yah
and you must not leave the zoo without seeing this
and you must not leave the zoo without seeing this
this is not the regular tiger this is- uh special species is the white tiger
yes
uh and one day they found one that was white uh he had gene mutation and uh maharaja or the ruler he started breeding them
so we have three of them
they are in an area where they have a deep pool
they are in an area where they have a deep pool
so sometimes you can see them swimming
yah that's right
so uh the zoo is really uh a must-see place i feel for people
yah
okay
so i'm going to find you other attractions
uh what are- what would you consider visiting a museum or an outdoor area
uh what are- what would you consider visiting a museum or an outdoor area
universal studios yes okay we can try and get universal studios uh and get you some pictures
universal studios yes okay we can try and get universal studios uh and get you some pictures
this is on sentosa island it's uh not so near that you can walk
you'll have to take uh bus and also uh take a shuttle of the outside of universal studios go into sentosa island
so you take a bus uh from near your hotel and i think if you ask the hotel concierge they'll be able to tell you where the- in fact i can tell you
so you take a bus uh from near your hotel and i think if you ask the hotel concierge they'll be able to tell you where the- in fact i can tell you
can you see on the map here
so harbourfront here
you get off the uh bu~ the- sorry the train- the bus stop in fact
and in fact if you wait there there are shuttle buses free of charge that will bring you into universal studios
you don't have to take the sentosa bus that will cost you an extra dollar because here uh universal studios is very happy to have you uh visit them okay
alright
yes uh but i'm not going to show uh all the rides
yes uh but i'm not going to show uh all the rides
you can just see here
just a picture this is easier to see
it's uh- you know if you like thrills and scares
okay
uh this is the transformer the ride you know you will be uh having the thrill of your life uh as you are you know uh moving around
let me just go through uh what they have here
let me just go through uh what they have here
so if rides you're interested in uh-
they have the battlestar galactica uh cylon
you like that
okay here's more
uh intense corkscrews and cobra roll
uh okay
we also have uh battlestar galactica choose your side human versus cylon
and you have the- you engage in the ultimate intergalactic battle between good and evil at world's tallest duelling roller coasters themed after hit tv show battlestar galactica
uh so uh- it's also ancient egypt mummies and obelisk
so you are transported back uh eighty years to the nineteen thirties to the golden age of egyptian exploration
uh here uh you can face the wrath of the mummy on the world's first psychological thrill ride
total darkness
uh on all sides you get huge fire balls swarms of scarab beetles and an army of warrior mummies
so uh-
so it's adventure all the way for you you know
yah
uh i can see uh how you will be very excited because i've also been to the disneyland and um uh to the universal studios yah and really uh engaging
yah
uh i think you'll get the most adventure here already uh at universal studios
hm playing football you have to hook up with uh the local teams i don't information on that because football is played uh- it's a team game right
so uh off-hand now i would not be able to tell you but uh if you asked your travel agents uh and- to source for you or uh we have more time to look into the internet and we contact uh a clubs or schools that are willing to entertain you then you will be able to
but uh you will not have time i think you know because uh-
yah
for the family uh do you want to shop at uh this resort the resorts world singapore
yes
yes
you can go down to chinatown and uh uh you'll be able to get bags and shirts very easily
uh along the street side
uh and prices are also affordable so you can buy more you know more variety
uh you can take the train from city hall station
okay do you see the red line
so beach road is just uh nearby okay
you can go to dhoby ghaut
this is a major intersection with three lines meeting
and then you take the purple line which is the northeast line and it's just two stops down to chinatown
okay
yes
it's also very near to uh your hotel
so let me show you funan centre
people get it products peripherals
i like that that's where uh singaporeans go
i like that that's where uh singaporeans go
uh so here you are at city hall
you can in fact walk
so- yes
so if you walk down uh to- uh let me see if i can get the map here
okay this is a picture of the store
uh we have buses and we have uh-
i think if you don't want to walk you can take a bus
yah
yes
so the funan place where you can do your shopping is here and your hotel is okay to the right there
can you see uh beach centre-
yes that's near
uh you can see uh the saint andrew's cathedral which is uh historic monuments
and uh nearby uh if you divert a little bit it's the first church built in singapore that's still is uh more or less in its original form with add-ons it's called the armenian church
it's not very far i mean i could walk the distance yah
so in the day before the race you have lots of things to occupy you yah
uh i think if you are in this area and you're willing to walk you will be able to see attractions as you're walking
uh so if you walk a little bit further down here you see the singapore river
so the race track is here okay uh around here
this is the singapore river
uh there are bars and restaurants here it's very scenic
and if you were to uh move down a little bit more-
if you turn this way towards the marina bay it's the merlion park
okay uh i don't know if you heard of the merlion
it-
uh it's the first emblem of the singapore tourism board when it was started
half lion and half uh fish because we're an island
uh and one of the early princes when he landed on singapore island he saw an animal so he asked "what was that i saw"
uh and one of the early princes when he landed on singapore island he saw an animal so he asked "what was that i saw"
and someone said to him uh "i heard that there's an animal called the singa" singa is lion
uh but we have no lions in singapore
we have no record of lions naturally born in singapore so perhaps he saw a tiger which used to roam in our forest or a big deer yah
so this is a place many tourist like to go uh to take photographs as uh you can see some of the tourist there
uh otherwise if you- then if you- after you have taken your photographs you can head back along the river and uh go down towards funan
and from funan you carry on walking you will be in chinatown area
yes
or you can take a break every now and then along the way
stop at a coffee shop and you can have a drink that many of us enjoy
uh we- do you drink coffee or tea
yes cold
so uh we too like it cold
you can have it with uh evaporated milk and uh you can add ice to it so it's called uh kopi-si
can you remember that
or you can just tell him with ice uh yah
yah they will understand
si means you're adding evaporated milk so it makes it really yummy
si means you're adding evaporated milk so it makes it really yummy

yes you can have uh bread and toast with it if you like
uh you can have a kind of jam made of coconut milk and uh sugar and pandanus leaves

so it's a fragrant jam that we put inside it's called kaya toast
kaya is the name of the jam
you just have to pack it carefully
oh no it doesn't stink in fact it's very fragrant because of the pandanus
yah
so you can get it in jars like this yah
so we have the description there
and they have cheese toast they have toast with uh butter and sugar with kaya
and if you want some more nutrition you can have soft boiled eggs
and if you want some more nutrition you can have soft boiled eggs
yes
in fact i just had it this morning
eighty cents for one egg
eighty cents for one egg
because i didn't want to eat too many
yah
yes
so uh you- this is something uh local that you can try
here are some pictures of it
if it is very hot you can settle for ice cream toast
i think that's a modern add-on
uh the traditional is the kaya toast the one in the first picture top left
so if your sneakers are getting tired you can give your sneakers uh a rest
yes that's right
i cannot get it done this way
you know sometimes you get it with these transparent parts that are supposed to be white but here uh they are all white
i think it's the temperature was there water and the fact that the eggs are very fresh
uh no because- if you look at the side bar here on the left can you see franchise opportunities
you have to pay them a lot of money to learn the secret
uh as you're walking in that area there is also uh pork
uh uh what we like to eat is uh pork bones in soup that you can uh try and it's also a coffee shop just down from the river near to where your stall is
uh uh what we like to eat is uh pork bones in soup that you can uh try and it's also a coffee shop just down from the river near to where your stall is
yah
and it's got a lot of garlic inside so the garlic is also yummy
that's a good thing about travelling alone you don't have to worry about you know smelling stinky or your girlfriend or your companion is going to scold you
yes
so this is the chinese version further down uh they're showing you some of the ingredients
uh no this is not spicy this is garlic uh alright
uh no this is not spicy this is garlic uh alright
oh but normally people put lots of pepper in it
so it's a spicy- so they- normally a lot of restaurants now leave the spicy options to you so that it's optional
uh it's optional so that you can uh put it or you can not put it in
okay

yes
most of the- uh they are not in the cage
in fact uh the night safari has been designed in a way and that uh the animals are actually are on their own uh premises but you doesn't have the feel that it was in a cage
uh there is a certain things that we have put in place so that the animals will not uh escape from their premises
feeding them-
i'm sorry
that uh is not possible because uh to ensure the visitor's safety we usually take a very good precaution against uh-
that uh is not possible because uh to ensure the visitor's safety we usually take a very good precaution against uh-
uh that's a black tapir
elephant and- uh it's not an anteater
uh it looks like an anteater but the anteater has a little bit longer uh nose
uh yah
you can see as uh on the- at the dining area we do have buffet which is also available in ulu ulu uh restaurants
this is uh some of the- uh we have a buffet we also do have the alacarte indian food and chinese uh mediterranean
uh everything is almost available there as well
because you see it is a screenshot of the bongo burgers which is part of the uh restaurants
ah and if you like to enjoy your meal uh in the night safari while you are taking the tram is also available
yes
uh no uh bongo burgers uh those are a little bit of- where uh they are mainly more to the western food
the um ulu ulu which is uh-
this is ulu ulu as you can see it from your screen right now
it's a buffet style and also alarcarte
uh bongo burgers is another one but if you really like some uh quick fussy food like kfc uh you have to be a little bit early because the uh kfc usually close at seven yah
so you have to pack your food before that time
so if you like some nice ice cream we also do have ben & jerry's which is also located in the premises of the night safari
yah ben & jerry ice cream
very famous
they have various type of taste and various type of flavours as well
yah you can see it from your screen right now
it is
well you- uh so for your two-day tour in fact um the-
if you really like the theme park one of them is you know universal studio as i recommend
if not then you probably would like to have the beach
sentosa also do have some nice beaches as well
uh not white beach but a nice beach
yah
romantic places
oh okay
for dating
right
uh in fact uh we also do have some nice dining area like um the singapore flyer which is one of the world largest observation wheel
yah you can also have some uh good romantic dinner out there
there you are
you can see it from here
hm singapore flyer
no singapore flyer is actually like the uh london eye
no it's actually a wheel- a big giant wheel
yes like a ferris-
yah ferris wheel
uh the singapore flyer in fact is standing at the height of one hundred and sixty five metre
uh no in fact you won't not feel the height at all when you are taking the ride
you have fear- uh okay
okay
uh then uh-
you've some problem on the computer
uh what about east coast beach
east coast beach is also a nice place
yah
we do have some cables- uh cable skis which is available at that area
uh yah
we have
like uh- you see the nice beaches
uh that's the east coast bridge
you can also do cycling along the beaches
yah
we do have uh bicycle for rental
you can take the bicycle uh and take a ride along the beach uh will- probably will cost you around by eight dollars an hour
you see we also have um family games
during the weekend especially there will be a lot of crowds which are there
yah
food wise uh you can also cycle and get some nice uh food- our local food especially at the nearby hawker centre
yah this is the cable ski that i'm talking about that you can see- it's a actually a cable which take them around on the east coast uh lagoon
it's not uh wind- uh wind surfing boarding is also available uh at the east coast park
uh yes uh if you plan a-
the schedule uh properly you should be able to do it
probably on the first day if you a- what do you have in mind
you are like some beaches or you like some theme park or you like some zoo
so that i can help you to plan out accordingly so that you can have a nice uh you know holiday here with your girlfriends
if you have to say from the airport you do not have enough time
east coast which will be a nice place to hop in
yes
if you are afraid of height then you probably would like to try sentosa which is also- which a nice place to visit
uh now-
yah
uh why don't in this way
maybe on the first day when you arrive i would like to say is that hm you can try to stay in a hotel near to uh this- in the city area
maybe on the first day when you arrive i would like to say is that hm you can try to stay in a hotel near to uh this- in the city area
uh probably at the one that i suggested uh near to the city area
then if you want something cheap uh that would be about ninety dollars a day
you can see from the internet
and from there you can actually walk down towards merlion park which is about- approximately about fifteen minutes or you can take a bus there as well
then uh from merlion park then if you have additional time probably you like to do some uh shopping uh along that particular way
uh there is only two bed dens inside there or they call it twins sharing
yah
then probably the second day if you prefer to uh catch uh the universal studio uh that will be able to fully occupy your two days in singapore
but if you like nature then you probably should try the zoo if you don't like the theme park
okay
uh alright
okay

there
so these are the transports available that you can go by train by bus hm

this one here we have um big new york where the uh films of steven spielberg how he makes such uh the- such scientific movie inside a small data
so this is the whole theme park of uh universal studio
in fact it's really required uh one complete full day to be uh completing the whole uh theme park
the theme park operates from morning at uh nine thirty
uh they will start at nine thirty then uh they finish their business around by seven
after seven it's purely mainly for shopping
there are some- lot of retailing shops inside available there as well as some fine dining restaurants are also available
this is the water ride
no~ but not a swimming pool
uh this is a small lake yes

yah this is actually uh a mock-up of the fountain coming down- the water coming down from there
yah this is actually uh a mock-up of the fountain coming down- the water coming down from there
yah
that's actually a fountain
a small little- oh if you will say uh water fall

it's not really very big
uh that's for decoration
uh it's not that as i say
uh if you want uh to have a good nice holiday come during the weekdays it will be good
if you want to come during the weekend then you probably have to um- have a little bit more time on waiting for your attractions
yes
in fact in universal studio there is a limit for the uh people visiting inside the universal studio
uh approximately about eight thousand visitors a day
maximum- yah
yes
yah they have a crowd control there so uh they if they exceed the number of uh visitors they will probably have to close the gate
yah they have a crowd control there so uh they if they exceed the number of uh visitors they will probably have to close the gate
uh security wise we do not have se~ uh much issue on that uh usually inside universal studio we do have lockers available
for every attractions there are lockers available which is uh for the first half an hour is free but anything after that is chargeable
universal globe is actually outside of the universal studio in resort world
the merlion in sentosa is actually known as the merlion tower
it's actually not called merlion uh- it's a merlion tower in fact
not mer~
yes
yah i'll show it to you right now
yah
then eh hm where the- hang on i'll just help you see the price of this merlion
correct merlion
it's actually hm-
these are some of the attractions available in sentosa other than the one uh in uh resort world
resort world is part of sentosa but is on the other side of sentosa which has separate admission ticket
sentosa is uh another attraction which is located inside uh far from- uh sentosa is actually the full island but the resort world is part of sentosa
yah
so these are the attractions available inside the sentosa island
yah
palawan beach as i say if you like the beach that would be also a nice place to go
it's inside sentosa island
yah it's a movie ride
you can see it from here
the recent movie on
you mean in movie theatres you mean cinemas or-
if you are staying uh near to orchard road there are uh some movie theaters are which are available there
uh the one next to the hotel which i uh say the budgeted hotel
uh plaza singapura has one of the movie theaters uh inside there
we call it the cineplex which has about eight theatres altogether
so you can catch any uh latest movie at that theater with very good sound system
so that's the other part and sound the sound the feeling of water if there's a water coming out from- you will get some- you'll get some sprinkle of water on your face-
yes
so- so that's the reason why we call it four d if it's three d then you get three d effects three dimensional effect
desperados are uh um hm-
desperados uh- uh yah
it's the same thing like um a four d movie but uh-
yah
desperados in fact is something like a horse riding shooting game
yah

uh when you go to the arcades you usually shoot at the screen
uh this you actually sits on um a wood- uh what you call a wooden horse which will take you on a bumpy ride
so how can- i help you further for the uh your holidays there
uh the most famous attraction
that is one thing for sure
the rides
in sentosa or you're referring to some other parts of singapore
um we call it gogreen uh segway
it's actually a cart ride uh in sentosa that is
yah
ecogood
it's actually a cart that they uh the attraction will teach them how to use this cart
uh without walking you can actually walk over on the cart itself
it's also- uh you have to learn how to balance it so that you can move the cart easily
it's what we call uh cart
this is one of them
not for lazy people it's for attraction
yah
yah that's on the luge and sky ride
they call it the luge
uh not really
if you want to see the whole singapore then you have to go to mount faber which is taking the cable car ride from there or you can also take the singapore flyer which you will be- so you'll be able to catch the whole part of singapore
so if you want you can also join the diving um- experience with our divers
uh yes indeed
of course not to catch the fish huh but just to touch
this is the one that you can see on the screen right now
you can still put your hands in to touch the stingray you can even feed the fish if you want
the shark um is also available
you can uh- we have to book in advance in order to have a dive with the shark
yah this is diving with the shark
that is not a fish that's a shark
that is not a fish that's a shark
other than dolphin this is a seal
seal uh
uh yah that's a dolphin
you can also dive in there with the dolphin
if you want- like to get involve you can also register with the underwater world
a fish usually
they eat a fish yah

yah
yah it's something like an obstacle
we also- we have the flying fox which they will take the slide down all the way to the beach area
yah that's the one which we call the flying fox
uh you're welcome
so i guess probably if you were to come for these two days your approximately expenses will be less than a thousand dollars
probably around about uh three to four hundred dollars if you are actually going for- not for fine dining if you have a budget that will probably cost you about five hundred dollars for the two of you
thank you

september is having uh a very nice event here in singapore
september is having uh a very nice event here in singapore
oh you're not into that okay alright
then good for you because otherwise the ticket will be very- a little bit more costly
oh you have a daughter with you then
so how old is she
she's sixteen years old okay so she's teenagers
and how old are you
yah may i ask
oh you are thirty seven
okay so you are coming with your daughter then
okay so you are coming with your daughter then
s~
okay
and do you have any budget in mind or take a places yah- or places that you may like to see in singapore
uh yes that also depends on uh which hotels you prefer to stay in a budget hotel or you prefer to stay a little bit much more premium hotel then you probably have less spending then
alright
but first thing before i go to the hotel can i just find out a little bit more from you
like for example if you are here in singapore you like to do shopping mall or you prefer to goes out to some theme park as well like theme park like you know um some movie theme parks or some nature walk visiting the garden all things like that or you prefer something else
so that i can you know put you- put it in a place or hotel whereby near to that place you spend less on transportation uh easy access to public transport so that- these are the things that i will have to help you to consider uh and put you into the right place
so tell me then
alright
you plan to go shopping a lot
okay
and uh any other thing in mind in that- other than the shopping
go outdoors
theme parks or probably to nature
any will do
alright
so if you are going for shopping then um it has to be somewhere nearby and if you prefer to go to theme park then it has to be also located somewhere near uh to the public transport as well
so uh do you mind um i'll like to show it to you one of the hotel which is quite budget and it's located um- wait huh
so uh do you mind um i'll like to show it to you one of the hotel which is quite budget and it's located um- wait huh
wait let me see uh
well in singapore here our weather- uh the temperature wise um maybe from twenty six degree to thirty six degree
it's pretty humid here
so when you come to singapore try to wear some loose clothing don't wear thick clothing it will be a lot more comfortable for you
right
uh like i- no problem
so let me just see whether i can pick up that hotel alright
it's actually known as hotel um eighty one at rochor uh which is actually a two-star hotel it's a budgeted hotel
now you- can you see from the screen itself where i'm putting this uh hotels up and-
no not the merlion
right
now if you were to take a look at the uh- you're seeing the hotel- you're seeing the hotel rooms right now or no
yes uh so you can see the hotel room right
now if you were to see from the screen itself the room rate wise i'm trying to get the room rates for you so that you can probably budget your holiday here huh
right so for the room rate wise you can see it's hundred and thirty five per room per night right
right so for the room rate wise you can see it's hundred and thirty five per room per night right
so that will takes off uh two hundred and seventy dollars from you
so out of one thousand dollars two hundred and seventy dollars goes for that
so out of one thousand dollars two hundred and seventy dollars goes for that
and for shopping street um the hotel that you see here hotel eighty one is located quite near to the train system as well i'll just show you the map where the location of the hotel is yah
right
you can see uh from here the blue um uh bed which is here is actually hotel eighty one rochor
one is the little india station which we have the ne seven
uh from your hotel towards these uh station is not very far away probably around about ten minutes of walking you should be able to reach that station ne seven which stand for north east bound train station number seven
and the other one which is ew twelve that means that is a east west bound train station number twelve it's actually bugis station
so if you are staying in this hotel- uh if you are putting up in this hotel
uh both of the access towards the public transport is quite convenient and not only that i~ you- it's also located uh near to little india
that's where a lot of indian products are been sold there specially ladies accessories you know and you are travelling with your daughter with you so probably you can find something uh nice clothing of indian style
uh you can uh pick it out along this little india where the serangoon road is located
uh you can uh pick it out along this little india where the serangoon road is located
um i guess i just blow it up a little bit for you
now i guess you can see it right now right serangoon road
the whole street which is along serangoon road is known as little india
many of these shops located at this area sells a lot of indian uh products from ladies wear to shoes from accessories uh anything you name it related to the indian community you have it there
so this is one of the nice shopping street you can find near to your hotel
the other one walking distance towards uh the uh rochor canal
you can see that there is another one which i put it the screen up here
right
uh bugis street is also quite near to your hotel walking distance is approximately about ten minutes away only
uh from the bugis street itself you can find varieties of um clothing
if you want cheap- a little bit- slightly much more cheap clothing uh maybe in reasonable price uh you can go to bugis village because those uh area they sells a lot of um t-shirts uh ladies accessories uh even for the guys if you need some watches you can pick it up from there
there are some- a lot of watch uh dealers which are selling watches over there as well
and small little gift shops are also there
if you need to make up uh there is also uh hair salon located at that area
nice shopping street in fact
so-
uh it's about ten minutes walk from your hotel
now you can see hotel eighty one rochor
yes it's quite safe uh in singapore
yes it's quite safe uh in singapore
um in fact nobody uh should bothers you when you are walking along the street so long as you know you don't um i mean- uh during the night time of course uh we will suggest you not to outshine yourself by putting a lot of jewellery
or uh because um uh this people we- uh in singapore here we are a very safe place but if you try to outshine too much and you're walking along the street then that is not very healthy for you or safe for you right
if you are wearing a decent clothing you know walking around the street nobody will bother you
yah right
so um from here to any other shopping area is quite near
even it's uh even it's quite near to the hospital itself you can see there's a raffles hospital nearby
so in case anything uh really needs- uh in needs of the medical attention there is also available nearby to your hotel so not very far away
albert street there is also another shopping mall very nearby
um there is one temple which is also a heritage temple that you should not miss in walking distance uh this temple here is known as the kwan im temple
we call it goddess of mercy temple very nice temple to visit
of course if you want to ask for blessing this is also a nice temple to visit yah
so uh shopping wise this is a nice area to be and of course uh if this- this is the shopping part right
now the second thing you want is also for some theme park right
a theme park for you daughter especially she's sixteen years old she wanted to try something thrilling
i will recommend you for uh this sentosa
i will recommend you for uh this sentosa
sentosa and- inside sentosa we have a theme park here known as the resort world
uh resort world in sentosa is actually a theme park um located inside sentosa itself
yes correct
yes it's actually a universal studio located inside the sentosa
and this universal studio if you are coming in the month of september let me just help you up to see the ticket itself whether how much it's gonna cost you and of course travelling from your hotel to universal studio
and this universal studio if you are coming in the month of september let me just help you up to see the ticket itself whether how much it's gonna cost you and of course travelling from your hotel to universal studio
uh if you remember just now there is a train station called ew seve~ oh sorry um ne seven that is from the little india
it will actually takes you to the harbourfront uh where the last stop is then you'll have to change uh this sentosa express to take you into the universal studio right
it will actually takes you to the harbourfront uh where the last stop is then you'll have to change uh this sentosa express to take you into the universal studio right
so that is a lot more easier not so much of um walking to be done
so click next on your screen right now you are seeing uh it's actually a calendar of universal studio
now since you are coming in the month of september and it falls on the twentieth which is a thursday
now since you are coming in the month of september and it falls on the twentieth which is a thursday
uh if you go on a thursday the um ticket will be a lot more cheaper if you go on the twentieth
uh if you go on a thursday the um ticket will be a lot more cheaper if you go on the twentieth
but if you go on the twenty first it will be a little bit more costly now because the friday is consider as a weekend rate
so weekend rate means uh peak rate so you'll probably have to pay a fee more expensive
so you can see uh on the screen itself the non-peak is actually sixty eight dollars for adults and child is you have to fall in the range of between three years old to twelve years old
so your daughter is sixteen years old i'm sorry you do not- uh you are not entitled for the children
so your daughter is sixteen years old i'm sorry you do not- uh you are not entitled for the children
so uh she has to go on the adult fare
so uh i think i guess it would be around about a hundred and thirty six dollars
so uh i think i guess it would be around about a hundred and thirty six dollars
so hundred and thirty six dollars together with your two sixty- uh three plus right
so hundred and thirty six dollars together with your two sixty- uh three plus right
so if um you are going in onto this universal studio uh we also do have an express pass which is available
now this express pass of thirty dollars is add-on to your original ticket price of sixty eight dollars
now this express pass of thirty dollars is add-on to your original ticket price of sixty eight dollars
the express pass means that you- it actually allows you to access to a shorter queue inside the attraction
because you know universal studio is a very uh new attraction in singapore so many other visitors will queue up for their rides and by queuing it actually waste a lot of time so a lot of them may wanted to purchase the express pass to get away from the queue
so thirty dollars additional if you really want to jump the queue yah
but of course if not then you can have a full day there which is the universal studio op~ uh the operating hour is between uh nine forty five in the morning and it will end in the evening at seven
now from your hotel- yah there are hotel transportation that you see on the screen is again you can see a ne seven
now-
uh in total of walking and uh waiting for the train it will approximately about half an hour
at the most
yes at the most yah
then from there if you- uh from there you take um the sentosa express which is also another kind of train that allows you for admission into sentosa and then you pay three dollars more so total six
so in all in all you pay around about twelve dollar
so in all in all you pay around about twelve dollar
six yah twelve dollar
yah
if you are taking the train it will ends you up in vivocity which is the last stop of the train system
and from there you have to take another train which lead you into sentosa island
and from there you have to take another train which lead you into sentosa island
so the connecting train is in the shopping mall of the vivocity
so if you take the train from the sentosa express it's only costing you three dollars
yah
yah
because vivocity is also a very nice shopping mall to shop uh which i don't think you will miss- i'll just give you uh an idea of this vivocity here alright
nice place to be nice shopping mall
yah
the shopping mall actually starts at ten and it will end in the evening at ten
so you can see getting there there are a few ways of getting
uh you can see uh the screen which is right now having by mrt can you see mrt
yah
so take the north east line and alight at harbourfront
so the station that near to your hotel is called the north east line
so you will stop at this area here called the harbourfront centre
so only from here you take the sentosa express to the sentosa island
so it's quite near the minute when you come back again after you did universal studio you can also drop in in this shopping mall and do your shopping before going back to your hotel
yah
right
right the um- the uh the universal studio is what you want to know more right
or you prefer something else
okay
uh if you're going for universal studio if you are buying the express pass you probably can end up in sentosa island again which is near- next to the universal studio
uh you can also enjoy a beach uh show which is very popular in singapore right now we call it song of the sea
song of the sea is actually located in sentosa and i just uh put up this for you in sentosa yah
so in sentosa you can see um on your screen right now
okay see the sentosa

so sentosa is another uh park whereby uh you can catch the song of the sea in the evening
it's a very wonderful show
it's actually a laser show um with fireworks and waterworks
i just give you small outlook of the song of the sea uh for you huh

um about two thousand five hundred visitors are able to get the seat for a single show
um about two thousand five hundred visitors are able to get the seat for a single show
additional shows only happens during the weekends saturday
so you can see um the normal ticket is at ten dollars so uh you can catch this that particular show before you end your trip uh in uh the sentosa
so you can see um the normal ticket is at ten dollars so uh you can catch this that particular show before you end your trip uh in uh the sentosa
so that will fully occupy your full day in fact
yes
you see uh from my screen here there's a lot of attraction which are here
uh we have the attraction at imbiah lookout
uh we have attractions at siloso point along the beach area and resort world
so you can see the resort world is the wonder i'm talking about of universal studio right
yah
it's actually on the right hand side of your screen you can see universal studio
so sentos~ universal studio is located inside sentosa itself
so other than going elsewhere for um- to take your transport by wasting a lot of time to get to the destination why don't you uh do the what you call the universal studio and at the same time finish up sentosa then
so other than going elsewhere for um- to take your transport by wasting a lot of time to get to the destination why don't you uh do the what you call the universal studio and at the same time finish up sentosa then
because sentosa is also a nice place to go
uh yah
if you have plenty of time then if you are buying the express pass probably you can also visit the underwater world which is located inside sentosa
but this sentosa underwater world only um opens from the uh nine am to nine pm so you have to catch that timing
it's actually a nice place to be
it's actually a nice place to be
but if you want your daughter to enjoy a little bit more probably you can uh put this sentosa in during the day time and enjoy diving with the shark package in sentosa underwater
but if you want your daughter to enjoy a little bit more probably you can uh put this sentosa in during the day time and enjoy diving with the shark package in sentosa underwater
if you are not going for the universal studio i should say yes it's enough
uh if you're going for universal studio then i'm sorry
sentosa one day together with resort world not possible
yah if you see- uh if you're not going to dive with the shark then i have guess uh it should be enough for uh less than a thousand dollars yes
yah if you see- uh if you're not going to dive with the shark then i have guess uh it should be enough for uh less than a thousand dollars yes
what's the good time for shopping
what's the good time for shopping
uh well-
you see as i say uh there are so many shopping centres around
uh the place whereby you are putting up is also a nice place for shopping
in fact you can get lots and lots of um clothing accessories for you and your daughter
and even if you want to become an indian for one day you can go to little india and uh have something on your hand put on the hand need to be drawn on your hand and see how it looks like to become an indian
uh they are not only from india but because the design are mainly catered to the indian taste
uh they are not only from india but because the design are mainly catered to the indian taste
like for example if you- uh the indian have a little bit more on the design of the god of uh the indian
so those are the design to the indian taste not actually made from india but some indian may have make it in europe
they bring it back to singapore to sell it uh to uh at that place
so there are retailer shops actually open at that area mainly catered to the indian needs not from india
uh yes indeed there are lot of restaurant which are there you can see down here in sentosa
if you want to enjoy the dining at the beach area we also have you can dine indoors and outdoors
anything you name it you can have it
uh if you are talking about dinning in the restaurant then of course uh it will be a little bit different compare to the street food or we call it uh the local food- i mean the hawker centres and the food court yah
because it's air-conditioner and it's a very good environment also isn't it
so you feel good-
uh yes of course
even if you would like to try some of our local dishes like the hainanese chicken rice they also available uh at the hawker centre
so if you are staying nearby to this little india uh there's lot of mall which have air-conditioner food court
you can try all those uh local dishes at that area
sometime if you really don't find you probably- uh and also very skeptical having the local dishes yah there's also a lot of western food available as well
yah
yes
the boat
the sentosa
uh dine and shop yah
boats
uh ya~ yah there- yah you are telling me boats so okay no no i don't see any boats here
there is some other ways you can take by the mean of public transport
um those are the few option you can take yah
by bus is approximately um also amount about the same about uh thirty to forty five minutes yah
yes
i will say train because- because bus you need to stop every traffic light the train got no traffic light so he's just cutting across
i will say train because- because bus you need to stop every traffic light the train got no traffic light so he's just cutting across
oh i see
the thing is uh if you're walking towards that station then it takes some time right
if you are waiting for a bus you just walk towards the bus stop that which is not very far from your hotel then you take pick up the bus and go
but it's going to be take about thirty to forty five minutes alright
but if you are taking the train then is a lot more comfortable because uh by walking towards train uh station there is the walking distance only
then from the train there is no waiting time for the traffic condition
if you are taking the buses then of course if there is a heavy traffic then you get congested the time may drag even longer
yah
correct
but uh the hotel which you are staying uh near to that particular area if you see on the screen now
you will find that along the street here there is a lot food court or we call it coffee shops available
they fry it on the pan and it's quite tasty with- if you dip it into a curry sauce
yah
for breakfast probably you pay around about uh three dollars you can get a good and nice breakfast yah
for breakfast probably you pay around about uh three dollars you can get a good and nice breakfast yah
uh well it- almost everywhere is the same
whether you change it in your place or you can change it in singapore it's still would be the same rate
yes anywhere will do
you need not- yah you need not to be in singapore
correct
the place that you are staying uh at little india there's a lot of money changer as well so you need not have to worry
even if you are not changing that money right now you can get the money changer at any other shopping mall
even if you are not changing that money right now you can get the money changer at any other shopping mall
there's a lot of money changer at the shopping mall so you need not to worry about your currency it's quite easy and convenient
there's a lot of money changer at the shopping mall so you need not to worry about your currency it's quite easy and convenient
yes change everyday
yah so you have to check it everyday
yah
uh well there is uh- no there is no places that you should not go to but um of course uh dark areas behind the shop houses you should not try to venture
the dark places behind the shop houses is actually not good
yah
yah
you didn't have to worry because along the way you can have burger kings kfc which is kentucky fried chicken mcdonalds is everywhere fast food is available
even if you are staying in your hotel if you're hungry intend not to get out from your hotel you can also call uh mcdonald they will deliver to your hotel
so- correct that is very convenient
well uh ya~ yah i guess uh you have heard a lot things that what you should ask what you should do what you should not do but uh one thing just bear this in mind treat singapore as your home uh that will be good enough
because if you treat singapore as your home deffinitely there is no other places that you should- what you should do and why you should not do
because uh if you treat singapore as your home you definitely don't throw litters in your home right
you don't throw papers at your home right
you don't throw papers at your home right
you don't spill all over the places at your home right
you don't spill all over the places at your home right
so you treat singapore as your home then nobody will fine you then there's nothing that you cannot do
but as far as if you i am- i guess you are not a smoker right
yah
then that's fine because smoking in singapore there is- it's not a ban but uh certain places are prohibited from smoking
no smoking is allowed but not in public places places like places at bus stop you are not allowed to smoke places in shopping mall you are not allowed to smoke
no smoking is allowed but not in public places places like places at bus stop you are not allowed to smoke places in shopping mall you are not allowed to smoke
the reason is because they want to make sure that you know um you have to protect the interest of the public
if you are smoking the smokers will not uh have as bad um uh influence compare to the one who is not smoking right
because their second hand smoke will cause more damage to the non-smoker
so that was the reason why we have restrict them from smoking in the public area
yes there is
uh so long it's at the open air and it's not in- and it's away from the crowded area it's fine
uh so long it's at the open air and it's not in- and it's away from the crowded area it's fine
and now you are asking about the exchange rate it's on your screen right now
yah
so you- twenty cents
twenty nine cents
twenty nine cents
uh yes
they are very friendly they are able to- most of them are able to speak english
no definitely not
if uh you do have give me call i will definitely help you up
yes we do have a safari here in singapore the most popular one is we call it the night safari
this uh night zoo in fact showcase you about the um night animals
and during the night time most of us are in bed sleeping we didn't know what is going outside in the nature
so you can see a lot of chimpanzee are very active but during the night time most of the chimpanzee are sleeping just like us
well there are some public buses which will take you there
well there are some public buses which will take you there
if you are staying near to that particular place you can go there yourself by public transport or you can also pick up their express buses there
you can see uh getting there which i'm gonna click right now
and you can see these are some the pickup points uh from the city area
from the city area means from the nearby area
so uh you can just take a walk from your hotel to hotel rendezvous it's about another uh ten minutes you should be at the hotel rendezvous
uh you can see if from here uh right
the mrt station you can take the mrt towards that area or you can even take the buses from here
you can see that the bus service number um nine two six and nine two seven nine two six and one seven one
it is located quite near to your hotel
so you can pick up those buses and go to night safari also
correct
it's thirty to forty minutes because the bus need to travel from your area which is the uh the centre of the singapore all the way towards the north area it's approximately around about that time yes
n~ um no in fact the buses are available until twelve midnight the train system also available until twelve midnight
so if you want to- if you would not be able to catch those two you can also catch a taxi which is also available the last mean of transportation to go back yah
and to get a taxi-
don't worry mostly the taxi fare if it's you are taking taxi probably it will cost you around about uh thirty five dollars
right
yah
but otherwise you can just leave a little bit early just uh before eleven you can leave
yah
so by the time you finish um your attraction inside night safari it should be around about ten
um it should be fine for you to get uh to your hotel without any problem
okay that uh really depends on you
for a normal person you will finish around about three to- uh three and a half hours you should be able to get done with it
yah
correct
well if you like nature singapore botanical garden will be a nice place to visit
and from your places to the um- now i got from your places to that uh singapore botanical garden
there is also a train system available
so if you were to see from the map here on the screen itself you'll find little india at that particular station over there
so if you take the train system down uh all the way towards- yah the- uh sorry
if you take the train system you can also lead towards botanical garden
if you take the train system you can also lead towards botanical garden
it's quite easy and convenient
it's quite easy and convenient
so yah you can take it down all the way towards the uh dhoby ghaut station change the train up there or you can take the yellow um the bras basah line all the way one round towards the botanical garden
so botanical garden will be a nice place to visit as well
yes botanical garden is free
and of course uh let me just pull up botanical garden for you alright
uh merlion is actually an icon of singapore
it was only created in nineteen seventy two- the park is created in nineteen seventy two
the lion head symbolised the uh founding of the island and of course the fish body just symbolised the humble fishing village
so uh that was the reason why we put it together and called it merlion
right
ah yes indeed
ah yes indeed
yah there you are that's the singapore botanical garden and this is- yah
this is uh how to get there
this is uh how to get there
you can see the yellow line-
yah
that will be the buses available for you to pick up to the singapore botanical garden
but uh if you are visiting singapore botanical garden you should not miss the national orchid garden
so there is a fees for you to pay in order to get admission again it's five dollars per adults and children have to be below twelve
correct
if you are going into the national orchid garden
if you are not then the admission for the botanical garden is free of charge
yes of course
uh you can take-
uh you can take-
there are only- there- yah there are some places like the night safari
the night safari uh photography is allowed but flash photography is not allowed
uh because during the night time some flash light from the cameras may harm the animal so it may cause the animal to run into danger
so that is the reason why flash photograph are not allowed inside the night safari
yah
uh it will approximately about half an hour to forty five minutes yah
i will suggest you to take the train it's a lot more easier
so-
not it's uh- from the airport there is a direct train from the airport to the tanah merah interchange which is um about five minutes of uh mrt ride yah
no
not it's la~ and not difficult to locate
from the airport to the hotel it's approximately about two to three dollars because you need to deposit one dollar additional for the ticket
from the airport to the hotel it's approximately about two to three dollars because you need to deposit one dollar additional for the ticket
it will be refunded to you immediately after you get exit from the train station and get a refund from the machine by slotting in the ticket back into the ticket machine
yah inclusive of this waiting time or waiting for the uh train to come waiting for while you're walking
so that is uh taking into consideration
no it's quite easy to read our maps
if you see the map here which is on the screen right now
if you see the map here which is on the screen right now
you'll find that the little india is there that's where your hotel is right
do you remember
yah right
so from little india if you were to see it's quite near to bugis and bugis is the one- that is the one that you see on your map it will leads you all the way to changi airport
can you see changi airport
on the right hand side which has a number three there
so changi airport has um a train system which will lead to tanah merah you can see tanah merah there and that is an interchange that you have to change a train just by walking across the platform
it will takes you all the way down uh towards the uh what you call uh the bugis area where you can walk towards your hotel
your hotel is in between little india and bugis
so it's quite near you don't have to worry
yes uh changi airport
yes uh changi airport
the other airports are mainly for military use and also meant for private jets and not for big uh passenger aircraft
yah
yes i will suggest you to get it done uh from the internet itself because um only when confirmation are there then they will give you the room
uh no definitely not
uh no definitely not
you- there's a lot of uh food court coffeshops are available restaurants are also available so uh don't worry

well you only have two days so i have given you the choice i have given you four choice to choose
right
you are most welcome
i hope to see you soon
and should if you have any more query you can uh- feel free just to drop by me again uh i'm happy to share it with you again yah
bye
same to you
bye
my name is mathew
my name is mathew i'm the tour guide three uh speaking to you right now
my name is mathew i'm the tour guide three uh speaking to you right now
how can i help you today and-
how can i help you today and-
alright
uh firstly can i know when will you be travelling to singapore
and do you have any budget in mind that you like me to assist you accordingly to the budget you uh propose
alright
uh first thing um you need uh- do you need a hotel to say in singapore right
or you have your planning of your own hotel
alright
or you prefer to travel in a little comfort with taxi
alright in singapore most of the taxis are run by metre
alright in singapore most of the taxis are run by metre
uh the maximum it will go from one place to one end of singapore to the other end will cost you around about forty singapore dollars to forty five dollars
uh the maximum it will go from one place to one end of singapore to the other end will cost you around about forty singapore dollars to forty five dollars
so if you were to use us currency you probably have to multiply by one point two
so if you were to use us currency you probably have to multiply by one point two
then we go by the mean of public transport which is the train system and the bus system will be good
yah
right
and i'll teach you how to go around
and uh before i proceed i need to find a few things from you
one is uh what do you have in mind uh when you uh come to singapore
so that was the reason why i'm asking this question right now
right
now um for you budget if you are going for a thousand dollars uh in singapore i'm very sure that you will not be able to get uh a good beach resort
now um for you budget if you are going for a thousand dollars uh in singapore i'm very sure that you will not be able to get uh a good beach resort
uh and transportation wise from the beach to any of the attraction which you would like to visit is not advisable because uh the transportation wise is not very convenient from the beach area
uh and transportation wise from the beach to any of the attraction which you would like to visit is not advisable because uh the transportation wise is not very convenient from the beach area
so probably you will have to look at um maybe taking somewhere in the city area where the train systems are available and they will be probably helpful for you to move around in singapore uh at uh a budget cost
yah
okay
right
uh right now i'm actually um i guess you are having a screen share with me right now right
alright now can you-
first thing uh i would like to just put it up to you that uh there is a hotel which i'm looking at right now which is called hotel eighty one bencoolen
first thing uh i would like to just put it up to you that uh there is a hotel which i'm looking at right now which is called hotel eighty one bencoolen
and this is actually a budget hotel
uh they have no breakfast in this particular hotel
but um next to the surrounding of the hotel there is a lot of we call it food court or coffee shops are there
so that means that in the early morning instead of getting your breakfast in the hotel uh which is hm uh which they don't serve uh breakfast you can pick it up at the next door where the coffee shop is
we call it coffee shop is basically because in the early morning and throughout the day they do serve coffee tea and you know cakes uh toasted breads
those things you can get it there at a very cheap rate
those things you can get it there at a very cheap rate
uh some of the coffee shops do open twenty four hours
some of them they only operate from the morning as early as six in the morning
and then they probably finish their business in the evening at around about nine to ten yah
so- eh renting a room is um we don't have those kind of uh- we do have those backpackers' room but it's not advisable to have a visitor first time
you try on the backpackers' room
probably you get-
backpackers
we call it a backpackers
yah correct
yah correct
probably a hotel like this uh hotel eighty one at bencoolen that would be good for you
you can see that the room rate wise is about hundred and ten dollars per night
and it is not really very costly
if you are staying for two-night you probably pay around about two hundred and twenty dollars at the most
so and- yah
you can see this is the hotel
you can see it from your screen right now this is how the hotel looks like
alright the bed is slightly a little more comfortable
right and-
yah
no in fact is hundred and ten is quite cheap uh if it's located at the city area
and moreover you can see from yourself from the screen right now i'm loading it up for you
and if you see uh carefully on the map itself
it is quite accessible um to the public transport
yes located in the city area where uh most of the public transports are available
okay you can see from the map right now um the blue uh icon which is here
okay you can see from the map right now um the blue uh icon which is here
uh it's hotel eighty one bencoolen
it's a two-star hotel
if you're going for three-star then it will be a lot more costly
so that's why you're going for a budget hotel
yes you can see down there it's written down there this is a budget hotel right
yes you can see down there it's written down there this is a budget hotel right
compare to the uh normal hotel you're looking at
so and it's not only that it's close by to the train system
so dhoby ghaut is the station which have three trains linking together
the cc one and ne six ns twenty four
uh these are the kind of trains connecting train
that means at these area it's an interchange of trains
so if you were to travel going to uh northeast you have the northeast line there
if you are going to uh north-south then you have the north-south train station
so it's all nearby and not only that you can also uh take a walk towards the ew twelve which is on your map
this is the east-west bound train
uh ew means east-west
twelve means station number twelve
so this is uh how nearby it is uh to your hotel walking distance
so probably from east station uh from the station dhoby ghaut station to your hotel probably about hm ten minutes' walk
and then maybe from your hotel to the east-west bound train another fifteen minutes walk and that's it
right
so definitely you would not be having uh those kind of facilities uh like the swimming pools and all those staff
then you'll have all those facilities
right
eh in fact this hotel do not serve uh food
they only uh rooms available only
uh there are bars and pubs which are there

uh there is a small little safe deposit inside your room
okay
uh yes we do have the other uh hotel which is also uh hotel eighty one uh put up a little bit where the uh rochor canal road is
there is also another hotel called hotel eighty one
uh let me just bring you back here
yah
a couple's room
a couple's room
alright
it's a couple's room
it's a couple's room
it's a twin bed there or you can also request for a king size bed or queen size bed
yah run this thing up
yah
yah
uh singapore weather uh the temperature is ranged between twenty six degree to thirty five degree
uh usually highest you can get uh thirty six but we do reach thirty six sometime
yah it's quite humid here
right
um i don't think there-
so you need not have to worry about
no of course not
okay here we are we have another hotel here which is a three-star hotel known as the fragrance hotel
okay here we are we have another hotel here which is a three-star hotel known as the fragrance hotel
and let's see whether do it uh-
right
yes it's quite near to hotel eighty one so the room rate is about hundred dollars per night
yes it's quite near to hotel eighty one so the room rate is about hundred dollars per night
so it's about ten dollars lesser only at the most
so it's about ten dollars lesser only at the most
it is also quite near yah
yah
so you can see it's located- yah
alright you can see that uh fragrance hotel is a little bit outskirt uh from the city it's quite near to the edge of the city
then i would say uh going out away from the city
yah it's located some yah
that is the reason why uh it's uh slightly cheaper compared to the hotel that i'm talking about just now
and you can see there the distance from this hotel uh to the train station where i show you about the dhoby ghuat it's a little bit further away isn't it
or don't you think so
you- either you can take the other station which is quite nearby which is only the train system called it ne seven
the ne seven is a northeast bound train
station number seven it's a little india station
uh it will lead you back to that station which is called the uh dhoby ghaut station
uh it will lead you back to that station which is called the uh dhoby ghaut station
the only difference is that this is near to only two station that is near to three station
uh i would say four station
that means there are connecting trains uh available just at the site
so it's like you know it's quite convenient compared the um uh this hotel that you are staying
eh there is only two trains that you can pick it up
so same thing uh northeast line will takes you about five minutes' walk towards that station
and ew will takes you another about ten minutes' walk to that particular station
yah
so you huh
sorry i cannot get- yah
sorry i cannot get- yah
what are the facilities there
okay
okay you can see that this do come with uh- this do come with a small little pool yes
there's small little pool restaurants are there
and if you are coming with your girlfriends then uh superior room will be good for you
sorry
what do you get your first- your one hundred dollar stay complimentary
what do you get your first- your one hundred dollar stay complimentary
i- maybe i let you see whether there's breakfast for you
i guess hundred dollars is not with the breakfast
i guess hundred dollars is not with the breakfast
uh we'll wait and see
uh no i don't think there is breakfast here
uh no i don't think there is breakfast here
uh no they do have breakfast
they do have breakfast if you are taking the executive deluxe room
they do have breakfast if you are taking the executive deluxe room
the superior rooms are not with breakfast yah
yah
no hundred dollars yah
so you can uh coffee tea uh some sandwiches are there
uh that's it
and not like this
that is usually the- in the hotel wise the restaurants are there
uh usually they serve the local uh we say the uh ancient asia uh deli~ uh food that is uh in southeast asia yah
yah
outside your hotel uh there is a chinese restaurant uh across the road
then if you love indian food indian curry that you have to walk across to that train station that i'm talking about
the whole street there call serangoon road in fact is um a place whereby eh uh most of the indian food are sold there
uh you can of course take a walk there if you want to
can you see that serangoon road
no do you- can you see the ne seven
no do you- can you see the ne seven
yah this is the whole street whereby a lots of indian food are sold here
lots of um indian related accessories and also uh indian goods which you uh will like to take a look at or to purchase them
and this is a very good street for uh tourist as well
uh yah
yah
so instead of going very far away staying in a nice hotel in the city if you stay nearby here quite near to the station and also near to little india where you can shop around to found out more about the indian community while living here
people who are staying in europe but they are indians
yah
okay
so- okay so hotel wise i guess this would be your choice right
um from here then we will go to your attraction right
um from here then we will go to your attraction right
uh right
so i guess uh you had heard about uh uh you said- just now you were saying that you love uh theme parks right
so this theme park the name of the theme park in fact is called the universal studio
yes
we have universal studio here in singapore
eh no usually- it will not be a package deal because you see the thing is you have a limited of time in singapore you only have two days
and with these two days you try to see uh what is uh most interesting here
and with these two days you try to see uh what is uh most interesting here
uh yah
yah i see- uh i don't think you will like to go to a place whereby you know uh when you reach there okay uh five minutes we have to go
that goes to another place
then you know it's like you don't visit the place at all
you just go there and uh see the entrance and then they leave
i- alright
so basically make full use of your time when you are here in singapore
if you uh in the later part if you have more budget and you wanted to stay for a longer time then that you can probably consider at the later part
alright
so probably if want to catch the latest in singapore the universal studio is one of the place that you should not miss uh if you like theme park
so here we are then you can see this is universal studio
and we have the transformer here the transformer ride
and transformer ride in fact is uh quite new
and uh this uh transformer has been showing in uh new york
uh but of course uh singapore is having one of the best of all
so i'm gonna show you right now um how to get there what are the ticket price which is involve yah
right
now how to get there uh to universal studio in fact from your hotel if you were to take um the northeast train which we call it the ne seven from your hotel you remember right
now how to get there uh to universal studio in fact from your hotel if you were to take um the northeast train which we call it the ne seven from your hotel you remember right
the ne seven
now the ne seven will take you all the way up to uh the station here call the harbourfront
now the ne seven will take you all the way up to uh the station here call the harbourfront
okay if you were to see below uh down here you can see northeast line mrt rail okay
okay if you were to see below uh down here you can see northeast line mrt rail okay
now the northeast line mrt rail- okay if you look carefully you will find that this is uh little india right
okay
so from you screen yeh the ne seven is the nearest train that you can pick it up
so it's lit~ eh the station in fact is known as little india
you take the train all the way from little india to the harbourfront which is here
the number six right
so that will be the ending part of the northeast line
and from the northeast line the same building itself there is a sentosa express which is there
but the distance from your little india to harbourfront approximately fare for the train ride per person is about three dollars
yah three dollars
yah three dollars
so from this uh station when you get out from this station in fact it's also known as harbourfront
but the building name is known as vivocity
vivocity
uh v i v o
yes
yah from the vivo station there is a sentosa express which eh will lead you into universal studio
yes there is an express train we call it the sentosa express
yes there is an express train we call it the sentosa express
if you will take a look here on your map- on your screen again you can see sentosa express
can you see the screen right now
still clicking
yah alright
so from your screen you can see sentosa express which is located in vivocity level three
so from your screen you can see sentosa express which is located in vivocity level three
you can pick up the sentosa express to this station called waterfront station
this sentosa express only goes into sentosa island and with uh universal studio is located inside this sentosa island
and it's run by the organisation called the resort world singapore
so resort world is also part of sentosa so you have to take that train to the uh universal studio and the station to alight is one station away only which is known as the waterfront station alright
but for this admission you will have to pay an admission fees of three dollars
three dollars for the admission
if you wanna save up some money again uh you can always do a morning exercise by taking a walk into the sentosa island which you have to pay an admission of one dollar
if you wanna save up some money again uh you can always do a morning exercise by taking a walk into the sentosa island which you have to pay an admission of one dollar
uh you wil~ uh are you with me on the screen right now
can you see the sentosa express there
can you see the sentosa express there
now if you- it states down there take sentosa express uh to uh located on level three vivocity lobby l and alight at waterfront and the flag fee of three dollars apply
so that means that you have to uh um pay the admission fee uh at the uh train uh at the sentosa counter
so they will get- correct
no they- yah approximately yes correct
yes
correct
yes
yes correct
yah
so uh that is possible if you choose either one of them you see
if you wanna take it uh take a ride in the comfort manner if you're walking all the way to get sweat in the early morning uh you wanna take a ride quickly to the universal studio you just pay the three dollars for the admission at this sentosa express
then of course that is a lot more convenient
if you choose um to take the pub~ direct public buses uh only applies for foreigners uh you can pick it up at bencoolen street or bencoolen's road which is quite near to your hotel
but you have to go to the correct hotel
so um you can see uh on your map right now uh under universal studio free shuttle service
that provided if you are staying uh nearby to that particular area
yah
let me see from here
um that's by seeing the opportunity huh
okay now um from the bus schedule itself it is seems like you can only pick up uh this shuttle service at summer view hotel which is not far walking distant from your hotel
but there is a timing for you to catch if you want to uh have a pick up from there
yes it go directly to the theme park
yes it go directly to the theme park
okay let me see ah alright the universal studio uh buses is actually free of charge
yah but you have to walk to that particular hotel
it's approximately about ten minutes
if you were to see just now at the fragrance hotel and i show you the map again
okay now can you take a look at your map right
you'll find that the blue uh ho~ the blue icon which is there is your hotel
and summer view hotel is located at this end
here on this side
you have to walk cutting across um the street itself
alright
so is walking distance still but uh the option is yours
now coming back um this is the main or way of transportation to that particular place right
and of course uh next thing is you'd like to know how much is the ticket for the universal studio right
yes the three dollars entrance fees applies to sentosa island
yes the three dollars entrance fees applies to sentosa island
yes correct
so going to uh-
so- correct
yah
so right now um i'm trying to uh put up the uh- i trying to pull up the season chart
and you can see uh in a while on your screen uh there is a universal studio calendar
the minute when you see the calendar just uh let me know
so that i can go through with you on the calendar to let you see and how the price are actually work out for the universal studio
well it's uh-
okay now uh you are with the universal studio calendar right now
okay now uh you are with the universal studio calendar right now
yah on the april seventh- now uh on the seventh if you are trying to go for universal studio uh you will really have to go pretty way in advance
yah on the april seventh- now uh on the seventh if you are trying to go for universal studio uh you will really have to go pretty way in advance
that means is probably you have to try your luck now in order to make sure that you can get the ticket online
now uh the ticket price if you are really going on the seventh which i would advise not to but you choose to go on the seventh then you have to prepare
now uh the ticket price if you are really going on the seventh which i would advise not to but you choose to go on the seventh then you have to prepare
uh there will be a huge crowd in the universal studio
and if you are going on the eighth then that will be slightly better
and if you are going on the eighth then that will be slightly better
but then you still face the crowd
uh but of course there is uh the secondary way out for this uh for the peak season we call it the peak because it's during the weekend
the adult fee is seventy four dollars and of course uh you are not senior citizen right
okay right
now the express pass at fifty dollars that means that um inside the universal studio there are two kind of queues which are there
now the express pass at fifty dollars that means that um inside the universal studio there are two kind of queues which are there
one which you are paying for a normal ticket you get into joining the huge long queue
one which you are paying for a normal ticket you get into joining the huge long queue
uh the other express ticket allows you to join the shorter queue
that means that if you purchase an additional fifty dollars uh on top of the ticket you have a chance to join at the shorter queue
that means that if you purchase an additional fifty dollars uh on top of the ticket you have a chance to join at the shorter queue
so that it cuts uh waiting time uh for the attraction
so that was the meaning of having the express pass
right so if you were to consider of getting the express pass that would be about hundred and twenty four dollars per person right
so you have about two hundred and forty eight two hundred forty eight
so you have about two hundred and forty eight two hundred forty eight
plus your hotel will be another uh two hundred dollars so about four hundred dollars now
plus your hotel will be another uh two hundred dollars so about four hundred dollars now
so inside universal studio uh what is being included
so inside universal studio uh what is being included
now in fact universal studio is a theme park and the minute when you purchase this ticket uh there ar no limits as on how many times you can go on that particular ride or attraction
yah
correct
uh as soon as the shorter queue uh available yah
so you can see um-
okay
now uh let me just go back to the other one which is there
now uh let me just go back to the other one which is there
now coming i'm gonna show you the map inside the universal studio
now if you are if your screen is ready just let me know so that i can go through it with you one-by-one like what is eh there to offer inside the universal studio
is your screen up there
okay right
so it's actually a mock-up of the jurassic park and in a small scale sky
and uh do you ride-
uh no they are fake dinosaurs
uh no they are fake dinosaurs
uh yah
no of course and then we also do have the uh if you have watched the movie called the water world
now that they are there inside this uh small green portion of uh fireworks here
uh that is the show which they are showing live
uh with uh live exhibit fireworks and um uh interactive uh performance uh right in front of the guest
not the original star ah
not the original star ah
right
then of course if you like the uh water rides and there is a water ride you call the repeat adventure which is quite nice and interesting
then of course if you like the uh water rides and there is a water ride you call the repeat adventure which is quite nice and interesting
it's something like a hydraulic wave that would takes you into the canal which will- uh let you have a very nice enjoyable water rides yah
yes of course
so in case if you plan to take this ride then you probably have to bring uh one more extra clothing with you
so this is uh the lost world
if you have catch the movie called the revenge of the mummy
if you have catch the movie called the revenge of the mummy
uh this is actually a part of the mock-up for the uh roller coaster ride
uh that is the ride which is available inside this ancient egypt
of course uh a few things here as well inside the universal studio food and drinks are not allowed to be in by guest
yah you have to purchase their food and drinks inside the universal studio
so food wise is located near to the jurassic park where the lost world is
and it's also located near to ancient egypt
so those uh you can get ala carte food um indian food if you want to
so it's available there
so food court is located at uh the jurassic park area
so this is-
well at food court usually the food which is serve there approximately huh i will say approximately you have uh one meal it will cost you approximately around about twelve dollars singapore dollar
well at food court usually the food which is serve there approximately huh i will say approximately you have uh one meal it will cost you approximately around about twelve dollars singapore dollar
eh well uh you can't compare the street food and the food court inside universal studio
because the universal studio have um lots of facilities inside the food court
like for example clean environment air conditioner yap
you know um you have uh facilities for young children huh
all those things are there
so of course uh to have that kind of facilities uh the price for the food of course is a little bit different huh
but if you take food court outside there probably it will cost five dollars
but if you take food court outside there probably it will cost five dollars
at the most fifty per cent more compare to-
but you can't get any food other than the food court inside there
so you have to take the food there
right
now uh then the other one is the sci-fi centre
sci-fi centre in fact uh has as you can there are so many lines which are there the blue and the red
now those are roller coaster track which is uh for the uh battlestar galatica
uh this is the world fastest and tallest roller coaster ever constructed
i would say fastest means it complete the cycle within one minute
yes
so uh that is a little bit different and in at the sci-fi centre we also do have uh the latest attraction now which you see just now the transformer
it's actually a three d i would say three d four d movie rides inside there right
it's actually a three d i would say three d four d movie rides inside there right
quite interesting
no nothing is required to be paid inside there except your food and the purchases done by you for your uh what you call souvenirs huh
no nothing is required to be paid inside there except your food and the purchases done by you for your uh what you call souvenirs huh
so uh all the things are
the ticket price inclusive of all the rides unlimited rides inside there
yah
so the other part is where you can see the new york
and new york if you have you- do you know the guy which is uh producing a lots of uh sci-fic uh movies
steven spielberg
yah of course huh
he is very popular in his scientific movie
now in fact for this person to produce a movie he in fact don't create the movie outside- uh not only outside uh the premises but he created the movie inside a theatre itself
so you can just imagine there you know you have um a strong tornado coming in
you know he can create a tornado inside the theatre itself to film it
so it's a nice place to see and experience
then um the other part is um this part here we call it the hollywood
that is where the dance are there
and of course lots of retailer shops are here to sell souvenirs of universal studio singapore
and the other one which is madagascar
if you have watch the cartoon movie called madagascar that uh is the place whereby they will be performing at the same time
then the last part will be the uh far far away which is- if you have watch th- cartoon movie called the shrek movie this is one part the movie which they make into three d's and it's a ride inside the um uh four d theatre itself
so this is the whole thing of the uh universal studio
to occupy your time yah
the operating hour for universal studio for the rides is from uh nine thirty the gates will open it will start from that time
eh the last ride will be at seven that's it
and after seven uh restaurants and retailer shops are still open
yah
no as you can see uh just now the shuttle service provided from- the free shuttle service uh usually has a timing
no as you can see uh just now the shuttle service provided from- the free shuttle service uh usually has a timing
so you have to catch the timing for the shuttle buses
the last bus left from uh resort world universal studio will be at ten pm uh sorry uh yah uh ten sorry
uh ten thirty pm yah
uh ten thirty pm yah
yah
yah
so if yo~ if you wanna spend time walking along the retailer shops you can also that too
alright
or otherwise the normal train systems uh they start operating from morning as early as five thirty and will the finish the last train at twelve midnight
right
yah
right
okay now uh so this will be occupying for your full day
okay now uh so this will be occupying for your full day
so you of course uh you can have dinner there and uh of course you also can do sentosa if you want to for the song of the sea right
a song in the sea in fact is uh laser show inside sentosa
uh let me just pull up the sentosa for you
so that it keep you occupy for the uh full day
okay right
if you uh to see on your screen right now you'll be able to see the song of the sea
yes
yah so the song of the sea is located inside the sentosa
yah so the song of the sea is located inside the sentosa
so that train ride from the waterfront to the beach station where the song of the sea is located is free
so that train ride from the waterfront to the beach station where the song of the sea is located is free
so you can take a ride there but you have to uh purchase a separate ticket for the song of the sea which is ten dollars per person
from the morning all the way until at end of the day okay
right
so the same day again the minute when you are done you can take the sentosa express from the beach station all the way back to the vivocity
or you can also take it back to the resort world where you can take the uh free shuttle buses for the tourist back to your hotel right
you like some shopping

right and now um for sim lim square it will be the nearest electronic mall to- uh from your hotel right
from your hotel
so um right
now it's walking distance uh probably it takes about five to ten minutes towards sim lim square
and uh i just show you uh where it's located so that you can easily get around
and uh i just show you uh where it's located so that you can easily get around

so if you want to take a walk you can take a walk
if you want to take the free shuttles you can take the free shuttles as well
but it's uh not very far away from your hotel so i would guess probably by walking would be uh good for you and save some time
only about five to ten minutes' walk at the most
right

they sell uh electronics like uh computer notebooks uh printers uh uh pda's tablets anything you need with deal with electronics there is available inside this mall

any purchases that you make in singapore above hundred dollars on a single receipt and you would enjoy a tax refund of seven per cent uh if you are travelling out of singapore by through changi- this changi international airport
so if you are travelling out from singapore through uh coach then you will not be entitle for the seven per cent rebates
so if you were to buy any electronics or clothing you- please ask them to give you a tax refund form
a tax refund form will be given to you by the retailer if you purchase a hundred dollars and above
right
changi international airport
there's only one international airport here

yah seven per cent
yah seven per cent
then-
yes it's only available for tourist
not meant for the local alright
alright so these are- there's a list of stalls which are there if you want to take a look
you can see that um this is actually a floor plan map of how uh level one is look like
you can see that uh there are so many shops are there even if you were to stand about two or three hours there i think still not sufficient
it's a and next to the sim lim square we also do have the clothing mall where you can pick-up some shoes or clothes pants huh
uh your girlfriend which is going with you uh she can spend some time there while you spend some time in the electronic mall
uh your girlfriend which is going with you uh she can spend some time there while you spend some time in the electronic mall
then you meet in-between
yah
uh next to sim lim square we have the um albert complex uh
uh let me just- yah albert complex yeh you can see- uh if you were to see from your screen right now you'll find that uh this is albert complex
and in fact uh sim lim square is next to albert complex
yah
so um-
alright
now can you see from here
from your map

so if you were to walk across follow the main road and just walk to uh sim lim square the electronic mall
and albert complex is next to it
and we also have the hindu temple which is around at the other corner uh within your walking distance
so you need not have to travel to much on transportation in fact by foot is possible also

because if you know there's a hotel like that's uh there but how to get towards that place that will be also another big problem for you
right
now um looking at the hotel is actually located somewhere in the city area uh that's where you can uh do your shopping if you want to it's also nearby to orchard road if you want to go
yah
yah the blue one right
so uh-
it's actually along middle road
yah middle road

and middle road is located in the city area itself
and of course you are very quite accessible to three uh train system here in singapore
uh one is the ew twelve
if you look onto your map that is actually uh bugis station
uh ew stands for east west bound train station twelve
correct
now do you also like to know how to get from the airport to your hotel right
because uh budget travellers you definitely want to save uh some money for yourself
yes but it's not budget terminal but i want to say is you are travelling on a budget so you definitely need uh you need uh a public transport to go around right
yes but it's not budget terminal but i want to say is you are travelling on a budget so you definitely need uh you need uh a public transport to go around right
right
so if you will just take a quick look at the ew eighteen you just take note about this uh ew eighteen is with bugis uh station okay
alright
so can you see the whole map of the transport system
so can you see the whole map of the transport system
okay
now if you were to look on to your right hand side you'll find that the changi airport is on the right hand side just on three-
yes
now the changi airport has a train system the mrt station which will lead you all the way toward your hotel whereby it's near to bugis
can you see bugis on the green colour track going all the way to bugis

and if you see there is uh two white coloured dot which is here and that is to tell you that there is an interchange in between if you want to get connected onto a different rail
for the yellow that we called it the circle line
circle line stands for cc yah
so you are not going to use that because you're gonna go all the way green until bugis
so you are not going to use that because you're gonna go all the way green until bugis
so from the airport towards bugis that will takes you about forty to forty five minutes of train ride alright
and for singa~ uh for getting into the train is very simple almost like the similar one uh in your place but uh the thing is in singapore here in what you need to do is you need to know the station you're going to get down
so when you go to the ticket counter you can um get the ticket for the bugis uh and you'll get your refund uh of the ticket at the ticketing counter
so uh the estimated fare will be around about two dollars sixty cents and with the deposit it will cost you three dollar and sixty alright
yes there is a tourist pass but uh if i'm not wrong it's a fifteen dollars uh three days pass or it could have take arrive on between yah
yes there is a tourist pass but uh if i'm not wrong it's a fifteen dollars uh three days pass or it could have take arrive on between yah
well of course depends on you whether you really need so much or not because you hardly use uh so much of the train can walk uh yah because you're only on two days with uh- hardly spend so much yah
right
correct
right
so at that area- in fact you are located in the middle of the city and from there uh towards some of the shopping area nearby is uh walking distance
right
so you can see uh from your hotel towards this area here called suntec city
now suntec city is one of the largest shopping mall in singapore
alright easily keep you occupying for the whole day in fact
uh i will say in the suntec city itself there is a fountain which is there
that is the world largest water fountain and it's called the fountain of wealth
these towers are being surrounded the world largest water fountain
okay
in suntec city we do have it shop
the it is known as ep centre
or otherwise you can also take a train down towards the funan it mall that's where you can pick up some of the latest electronic gadget
right
uh looking at your vicinity uh you are also located quite near to waterloo street
the waterloo street is another uh nice spot for tourist uh specially visiting the uh waterloo street temple
alright i'm blowing this thing up for you to let you have a look at the waterloo street yah
now if you were to look on to your right hand side this is your hotel
right
and next to the temple there is also a hindu temple which is also a very heritage uh temple yah
so in fact uh you are also able to get access into our hawker centre
this hawker centre in fact is referring to food court

right
you can estimate yourself if you- you are not a vegetarian aren't you
alright good
now if it's not a vegetarian then why it is not an issue because most of the food here- uh if you were to go to a hawker centre estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars
now if it's not a vegetarian then why it is not an issue because most of the food here- uh if you were to go to a hawker centre estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars

so hainanese chicken rice uh in fact once generated from that particular street
yah
so you can get the traditional hainanese chicken rice from there
the cost of the chicken rice if it's your normal dishes will probably cost you around about three fifty
yah
so if you order another cup of drinks probably about a dollar plus and then makes about to four dollar five dollars per meal
alright
now i guess you have uh just now asked me about universal studio right

uh one of the newest one is the transformer

so i guess uh that is the bus number you can take towards vivocity to get your ride on to sentosa express to universal studio
the free shuttle buses is only available at certain location
alright uh the place where you are staying right now- that you are staying will be at uh the bugis it's quite near to swiss the stamford hotel
okay
now swiss the stamford hotel is not far away from your hotel but you will have to take note about the timing for the free shuttle bus
now swiss the stamford hotel just take note this first and i will show you the location of the swiss the stamford hotel uh right now
okay yah
now take a look on the map it's coming up right now on your screen
right can you see your hotel
now can you see this hotel here
now can you see this hotel here
correct
so this is the location where you can pick up the free shuttle bus
so this is the location where you can pick up the free shuttle bus
you have to walk from your hotel all the way to this hotel here to pick up the free rides or the free shuttle service to the universal studio

obviously you like to know um how much is gonna cost you for the ticket for the admission am i right to say that
everybody are very keen on what their budget
everybody are very keen on what their budget
okay let me pull out the other screen for you and i'll show you how to get your ticket
now i'm gonna pull out a chart right now
a chart whereby the universal studio two thousand and twelve calendar
alright
you can see the calendar right now on your page
since you are travelling in the month of august you'll find that a lot of them are in orange in colour that means that is non-peak
on the left yah sixty eight dollars
yah
then of course if you have two person is going then you have the one twenty one thirty six yah
and of course you can see that there is an express pass at thirty dollars
uh what is that for
now the express pass actually pays on top of your uh normal admission
uh yes i will not say no queuing up but on a shorter queue
on a shorter queue yah
so you pay thirty dollars just to get away from getting uh queuing up
yah along and wasting your time in the uh queuing up for the rides yah
right
so this is how the price are being range okay
now because uh starting from may the twenty sixth onward it's actually a school holiday
now because uh starting from may the twenty sixth onward it's actually a school holiday
the children- the school children has one month of this school holiday
they made as year school holidays
correct
now and the full rate has carry another meaning for it
the full rate means that is super peak and you probably might not be able to get a ticket if you do not go one month in advance
yah
so that is the meaning of this super peak
and there is also um a crowds management or crowds capacities are limited inside the universal studio
the-
uh yes in fact right
so if you want to get in around that time then probably you have to pay a lot more like the super peak is seventy four you have to add another fifty you get about hundred and twenty four
a little bit costly would be on the budget huh
alright
now coming back i think you would like to know uh what is there to offer you inside universal studio
now this is another screen which is gonna come up into your computer and this in fact is the whole area of the universal studio
now this is another screen which is gonna come up into your computer and this in fact is the whole area of the universal studio
yah exploring the seven zones yah
yah exploring the seven zones yah
and this seven zones compresses of rides movies uh actions alright uh and also restaurant as well
so depends on you

okay we go to sci-fi city
now both of the stripes is known as battlestar galactica
yah battlestar galactica
you- have you watch the movie battlestar galactica
okay
now just before the pilot got into the aircraft what did they do
what did they do
before they got onto the aircraft they were supposed to sit onto uh a
yah a chasing ride right
we call it human versus cylon is because both of this roller coaster will start simultaneously at the same time
so they are actually challenging their speed with one another crisscross- uh cutting across one another and you- the whole duration is only about one minute of the ride
uh that's fast
if you are seating in car you don't feel anything but if you are flying outside then you definitely feel a lot of impact
then-
then we have the transformer here
uh we- you have- you seen the movie called transformer right
alright
this transformer is very new in universal studio and it actually give you a feeling that you are in the automist uh fighting battles against the um uh the bad guys huh
so-
it's a three d in fact yes
you are supposed to wear the glasses and of course uh the rides will take you up and down fronting turning swinging it's very interesting
that is one of the best i will say so far
uh usually it takes about five minutes and above
a long but good and fun
a long but good and fun
right
uh so this is um-
right
uh smoking is prohibited at most of the sheltered area
so- uh no we don't have any smoking area inside universal studio
then you should stay in singapore you'll be quit uh smoking
now uh this is universal studio
so uh if you have done this universal studio and you have some more time uh another place that you- that i would like to recommend you is to go to sentosa
now inside this sentosa is um only uh a train ride of uh two station away from uh the universal studio alright
now inside this sentosa is um only uh a train ride of uh two station away from uh the universal studio alright
now uh one of the uh most exciting area that i will like you to go is to visit the song of the sea in the evening because the minute once you are done with universal studio uh you would should be around about six to seven pm right
and since you have the time you should uh make your way to sentosa and visit this song of the sea uh which is- the show is happening at seven forty and eight forty daily alright
and at beach station you can pick up the ticket at the ticketing counter

or maybe there's another way
you can make him- you can make the additional person sleep on the floor

subject to request availability of the hotel
say if you ask for a queen sized bed probably three person can squeeze in
but uh-
yah or the other one can get uh one more additional room
but um then you take turn to sleep on a bigger bed
uh yes i would say because you can see that uh you were not be able to get such a good hotel rate

then you find it uh too much of the pounding i can't take it
so you can go outta here
so without paying a cover charge
but if you are going to uh clarke quay and then uh on different pubs you have to pay cover charge

so this is around about three pubs all together uh for the price of one
and if you like you can probably uh try our singapore made zero degrees tiger beer
